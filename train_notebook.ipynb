'cause i've been by myself all night long hoping you're someone i used to know you look like a movie, you sound like a song my god, this reminds me of when we were young let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time that we might be exactly like we were before we realised we were sad of getting old, it made us restless it was just like a movie, it was just like a song i was so scared to face my fears nobody told me that you'd be here and i swear you'd moved overseas that's what you said when you left me i will leave my heart at the door i won't say a word they've all been said before, you know so why don't we just play pretend like we're not scared of what is coming next or scared of having nothing left? look, don't get me wrong i know there is no tomorrow all i ask is if this is my last night with you hold me like i'm more than just a friend give me a memory i can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends 'cause what if i never love again? i don't need your honesty it's already in your eyes and i'm sure my eyes, they speak for me no one knows me like you do and since you're the only one that mattered tell me, who do i run to? skyfall is the theme song for the twenty-third james bond film of the same name. this is the end hold your breath and count to ten feel the earth move, and then hear my heart burst again for this is the end i've drowned and dreamt this moment so overdue, i owe them swept away, i'm stolen let the sky fall when it crumbles we will stand tall face it all together let the sky fall when it crumbles we will stand tall face it all together at skyfall at skyfall skyfall is where we start a thousand miles and poles apart where worlds collide and days are dark you may have my number, you can take my name but you'll never have my heart adele played guitar on the record, and it was this riff that began the song. she told the just the guitar, okay, cool this was all you, none of it me you put your hands on, on my body and told me, mmm you told me you were ready for the big one, for the big jump i'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me, mmm that was what you told me i'm giving you up i've forgiven it all you set me free send my love to your new lover treat her better we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts we both know we ain't kids no more send my love to your new lover treat her better we've gotta let go of all of our ghosts we both know we ain't kids no more i built a house for a love to grow i was so young that it was hard to know i'm as lost now as i was back then always make a mess of everything it's about time that i face myself all i do is bleed into someone else painting walls with all my secret tears filling rooms with all my hopes and fears but, oh my oh my i'll never learn if i never leap i'll always yearn if i never speak to be loved and love at the highest count means to lose all the things i can't live without let it be known that i will choose to lose it's a sacrifice, but i can't live a lie let it be known, let it be known that i tried i'm so afraid, but i'm open wide i'll be the one to catch myself this time tryna learn to lean into it all ain't it funny how the mighty fall? looking back, i don't regret a thing yeah, i took some bad turns that i am owning i'll stand still and let the storm pass by keep my heart safe till the time feels right

rodrigos debut single. it is a rumored love ode about moving on from her past relationship with joshua bassett, who supposedly started dating sabrina carpenter, by doing the one i got my driver's license last week just like we always talked about 'cause you were so excited for me to finally drive up to your house but today, i drove through the suburbs crying 'cause you weren't around and you're probably with that blonde girl who always made me doubt she's so much older than me she's everything i'm insecure about yeah, today, i drove through the suburbs 'cause how could i ever love someone else? and i know we weren't perfect, but i've never felt this way for no one and i just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that i'm gone guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me 'cause you said forever, now i drive alone past your street and all my friends are tired of hearing how much i miss you, but i kinda feel sorry for them 'cause they'll never know you the way that i do yeah, today, i drove through the suburbs and pictured i was driving home to you well, good for you, i guess you moved on really easily you found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? and good for you, i guess that you've been workin' on yourself i guess that therapist i found for you, she really helped now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl well, good for you you look happy and healthy, not me if you ever cared to ask good for you you're doin' great out there without me, baby god, i wish that i could do that i've lost my mind, i've spent the night cryin' on the floor of my bathroom but you're so unaffected, i really don't get it but i guess good for you well, good for you, i guess you're gettin' everything you want you bought a new car and your career's really takin' off it's like we never even happened baby, what the fuck is up with that? and good for you, it's like you never even met me remember when you swore to god i was the only person who ever got you? well, screw that, and screw you you will never have to hurt the way you know that i do hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now how's the castle built off people you pretend to care about? just what you wanted look at you, cool guy, you got it i see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when i close my eyes six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise i loved you truly you gotta laugh at the stupidity 'cause i've made some real big mistakes but you make the worst one look fine i should've known it was strange you only come out at night i used to think i was smart but you made me look so naive the way you sold me for parts as you sunk your teeth into me, oh bloodsucker, fame fucker bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire and every girl i ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news you called them crazy, god, i hate the way i called 'em crazy too you're so convincing how do you lie without flinching? oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill can't figure out just how you do it and god knows i never will went for me and not her 'cause girls your age know better car rides to malibu strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two and tradin' jackets laughin 'bout how small it looks on you watching reruns of glee bein' annoying, singin in harmony i bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm so when you gonna tell her that we did that, too? she thinks it's special, but it's all reused that was our place, i found it first i made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you do you get déjà vu when shes with you? do you get déjà vu? hmm do you get déjà vu, huh? do you call her, almost say my name? cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same another actress i hate to think that i was just your type and i bet that she knows billy joel cause you played her \"uptown girl\" you're singin' it together now i bet you even tell her how you love her in between the chorus and the verse we broke up a month ago your friends are mine, you know i know you've moved on, found someone new one more girl who brings out the better in you and i thought my heart was detached from all the sunlight of our past but she's so sweet, she's so pretty does she mean you forgot about me? oh, i hope you're happy but not like how you were with me i'm selfish, i know, i can't let you go so find someone great, but don't find no one better i hope you're happy, but don't be happier and do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen? an eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean remember when i believed you meant it when you said it first to me? and now i'm pickin' her apart like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart but she's beautiful, she looks kind she probably gives you butterflies ooh-ooh-ooh ah-ah-ah-ah-ah brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah i played dumb, but i always knew that you talked to her, maybe did even worse i kept quiet so i could keep you and ain't it funny how you ran to her the second that we called it quits? and ain't it funny how you said you were friends? now it sure as hell don't look like it you betrayed me and i know that you'll never feel sorry for the way i hurt, yeah you talked to her when we were together loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter it took you two weeks to go off and date her guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor now you bring her around just to shut me down show her off like she's a new trophy and i know if you were true, there's no damn way that you could fall in love with somebody that quickly i have nightmares each week 'bout that friday in may one phone call from you and my entire world was changed trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers took everything i loved and crushed it in between your fingers and i doubt you ever think about the damage that you did but i hold onto every detail like my life depends on it my undying love, now, i hold it like a grudge and i hear your voice every time that i think i'm not enough and i try to be tough, but i wanna scream how could anybody do the things you did so easily? and i say i don't care, i say that i'm fine but you know i can't let it go, i've tried, i've tried, i've tried for so long it takes strength to forgive, but i don't feel strong the arguments that i've won against you in my head in the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed yeah, i'm so tough when i'm alone, and i make you feel so guilty and i fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry and i try to understand why you would do this all to me you must be insecure, you must be so unhappy and i know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people and we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal lacy, the fourth track of guts, sees olivia blur the line between envy and homoeroticism. in one lens, rodrigo embraces her

as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer regretting him was like wishing you never found

haven't been sleeping stayin' up, playing back myself leavin' when your birthday passed and i didn't call then i think about summer, all the beautiful times i watched you laughing from the passenger side and realized i loved you in the fall you, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me you have knocked me off my feet again got me feeling like i'm nothing you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard calling me out when i'm wounded you, pickin' on the weaker man well, you can take me down but you don't know what you don't know someday, i'll be livin' in a big, ole city and all you're ever gonna be is mean someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me and all you're ever gonna be is mean why you gotta be so mean? you, with your switching sides and your wildfire lies and your humiliation you have pointed out my flaws again as if i don't already see them i walk with my head down, trying to block you out 'cause i'll never impress you i just wanna feel okay again i used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us how we met and the sparks flew instantly and people would say, \"they're the lucky ones\" i used to know my place was the spot next to you now, i'm searching the room for an empty seat 'cause lately, i don't even know what page you're on oh, a simple complication miscommunications lead to fallout so many things that i wish you knew so many walls up, i can't break through now, i'm standin' alone in a crowded room and we're not speakin' and i'm dyin' to know is it killin' you like it's killin' me? yeah i don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now he said the way my blue eyes shined put those georgia stars to shame that night i said, \"that's a lie\" just a boy in a chevy truck that had a tendency of gettin' stuck on backroads at night and i was right there beside him all summer long and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone but when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song the one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me september saw a month of tears and thankin' god that you weren't here to see me like that but in a box beneath my bed is a letter that you never read from three summers back just thought it state the obvious, i didn't get my perfect fantasy i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy that's fine, you won't mind if i say by the way i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin' so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time as far as i'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn there's no time for tears, i'm just sittin' here planning my revenge there's nothin' stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends and if you come around sayin' sorry to me my daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be 'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin' so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time as far as i'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn and if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself 'cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health teardrops on my guitar illustrates the unrequited love taylor felt for classmate drew hardwick. taylor told fans that drew would often ask her for advice and date ideas for his girlfriend, and she would drew looks at me i fake a smile so he won't see that i want and i'm needing everything that we should be i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about and she's got everything that i have to live without drew talks to me i laugh 'cause it's just so funny that i can't even see anyone when he's with me he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do drew walks by me can he tell that i can't breathe? and there he goes, so perfectly the kind of flawless i wish i could be i don't know what i want, so don't ask me 'cause i'm still trying to figure it out don't know what's down this road, i'm just walking trying to see through the rain coming down even though i'm not the only one who feels the way i do i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on oh, i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world got the radio on, my old blue jeans and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve feeling lucky today, got the sunshine could you tell me what more do i need? and tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah but that's okay i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on oh, i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world you have a way of coming easily to me and when you take, you take the very best of me so i start a fight 'cause i need to feel something and you do what you want 'cause i'm not what you wanted oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray and i stood there loving you and wished them all away and you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day so just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through i've never been anywhere cold as you the outside was written by swift about loneliness. she wrote it when just she was 12 years old. its about what i was going through i didn't know what i would find when i went looking for a reason, i know i didn't read between the lines and, baby, i've got nowhere to go i tried to take the road less traveled by but nothing seems to work the first few times am i right? so how can i ever try to be better? nobody ever lets me in i can still see you, this ain't the best view on the outside looking in i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside you saw me there, but never knew that i would give it all up to be a part of this, a part of you and now, it's all too late, so you see you could've helped if you had wanted to but no one notices until it's too late to do anything i wrote about one of seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty is the face in the mirror looking back at you you walk around here thinking you're not pretty but that's not true 'cause i know you hold on, baby, you're losing it the water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry, but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone, oh i guess it's true that love was all you wanted 'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change hoping it will end up in his pocket but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay it's not his price to pay hold on, baby, you're losing it the water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go and no one knows that you cry, but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone, oh oh, oh cory's eyes are like a jungle he smiles, it's like the radio he whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows there's pretty girls on every corner they watch him as he's walking home saying, \"does he know?\" will you ever know? you're beautiful, every little piece, love don't you know you're really gonna be someone? ask anyone and when you find everything you looked for i hope your life leads you back to my door oh, but if it don't stay beautiful cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day i'm taking pictures in my mind so i can save 'em for a rainy day it's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away i should say, \"hey, by the way\" it's strange to think the songs we used to sing the smiles, the flowers, everything is gone yesterday, i found out about you even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong you say that you'd take it all back given one chance it was a moment of weakness and you said yes you should've said no, you should've gone home you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go you should've known that word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me and i should've been there in the back of your mind i shouldn't be asking myself why you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet you should've said no baby, and you might still have me you can see that i've been cryin' and baby, you know all the right things to say but do you honestly expect me to believe we could ever be the same? she said i was seven and you were nine i looked at you like the stars that shined in the sky, the pretty lights and our daddies used to joke about the two of us growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes and said, \"oh, my, my, my\" take me back to the house in the backyard tree said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me you never did, you never did take me back when our world was one block wide i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried just two kids, you and i oh, my, my, my, my well, i was sixteen when suddenly i wasn't that little girl you used to see but your eyes still shined like pretty lights and our daddies used to joke about the two of us they never believed we'd really fall in love and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes and said, \"oh, my, my, my\" i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car he's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel the other on my heart i look around, turn the radio down he says, \"baby, is something wrong?\" i say, \"nothin', i was just thinkin' how we don't have a song\" and he says our song is a slammin' screen door sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window when we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'cause it's late and your mama don't know our song is the way you laugh the first date, \"man, i didn't kiss her and i should have\" and when i got home, 'fore i said \"amen\" askin' god if he could play it again i was walking up the front porch steps after everythin' that day had gone all wrong and been trampled on and lost and thrown away got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed i almost didn't notice all the roses and the note that said friday night beneath the stars in a field behind your yard you and i are painting pictures in the sky and sometimes, we don't say a thing just listen to the crickets sing everything i need is right here by my side and i know everything about you i don't wanna live without you i'm only up when you're not down don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground it's like no matter what i do well, you drive me crazy half the time the other half, i'm only tryin' to let you know that what i feel is true and i'm only me when i'm with you just a small-town boy and girl livin' in a crazy world tryna figure out what is and isn't true and i don't try to hide my tears my secrets or my deepest fears through it all, nobody gets me like you do she can't see the way your eyes light up when you smile she'll never notice how you stop and stare whenever she walks by and you can't see me wanting you the way you want her but you are everything to me and i just wanna show you she don't even know you she's never gonna love you like i want to and you just see right through me but if you only knew me we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable instead of just invisible oh, yeah, oh there's a fire inside of you that can't help but shine through she's never gonna see the light no matter what you do it appears as the why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now? why would you wanna make the very first scar? why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? maybe i should've seen the signs should've read the writing on the wall and realized by the distance in your eyes that i would be the one to fall no matter what you say i still can't believe that you would walk away it don't make sense to me, but why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now? why would you wanna make the very first scar? why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors it's the mornin' of your very first day you say \"hi\" to your friends you ain't seen in a while try and stay out of everybody's way it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here for the next four years in this town hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say \"you know, i haven't seen you around before\" 'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're gonna believe them and when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out well, count to ten, take it in this is life before you know who you're gonna be fifteen you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail and soon enough, you're best friends laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool we'll be outta here as soon as we can and then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car and you're feelin' like flyin' and your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one and you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends when the night ends mmm-mm, mm-mm mmm-mm, mm-mm mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah hey, stephen, i know looks can be deceiving but i know i saw a light in you and as we walked, we were talking i didn't say half the things i wanted to of all the girls tossing rocks at your window i'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold hey, stephen, boy, you might have me believing i don't always have to be alone 'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel can't help it

'cause how could i ever love someone else? and i know we weren't perfect, but i've never felt this way for no one! and i just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that i'm gone, guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me. 'cause you said forever, now i drive alone past your street! and all my friends are tired, of hearing how much i miss you, but, i kinda feel sorry for them. 'cause they'll never know you the way that i do! yeah, today, i drove through the suburbs! and pictured i was driving home to you, well, good for you, i guess you moved on really easily. you found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks. remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? and good for you, i guess that you've been workin' on yourself, i guess that therapist i found for you, she really helped. now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl! well, good for you, you look happy and healthy, not me. if you ever cared to ask. good for you! you're doin' great out there without me, baby. god, i wish that i could do that! i've lost my mind, i've spent the night. cryin' on the floor of my bathroom. but you're so unaffected, i really don't get it, but i guess good for you, well, good for you, i guess you're gettin' everything you want! you bought a new car and your career's really takin' off. it's like we never even happened! baby, what the fuck is up with that? and good for you, it's like you never even met me! remember when you swore to god i was the only. person who ever got you? well, screw that, and screw you. you will never have to hurt the way you know that i do! hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now. how's the castle built off people you pretend to care about? just what you wanted, look at you, cool guy, you got it. i see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when i close my eyes. six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise. i loved you truly. you gotta laugh at the stupidity. 'cause i've made some real big mistakes. but you make the worst one look fine, i should've known it was strange. you only come out at night. i used to think i was smart. but you made me look so naive, the way you sold me for parts. as you sunk your teeth into me, oh. bloodsucker, fame fucker, bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire. and every girl i ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news, you called them crazy, god, i hate the way i called 'em crazy too. you're so convincing, how do you lie without flinching? oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill! can't figure out just how you do it and god knows i never will? went for me and not her. 'cause girls your age know better. car rides to malibu, strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two. and tradin' jackets, laughin 'bout how small it looks on you. watching reruns of, glee, bein' annoying, singin in harmony. i bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm. so when you gonna tell her that we did that, too? she thinks it's special, but it's all reused. that was our place, i found it first. i made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you. do you get déjà vu when shes with you? do you get déjà vu? hmm? do you get déjà vu, huh? do you call her, almost say my name? cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same. another actress, i hate to think that i was just your type. and i bet that she knows billy joel, cause you played her \"uptown girl\". you're singin' it together, now i bet you even tell her how you love her! in between the chorus and the verse, we broke up a month ago. your friends are mine, you know i know. you've moved on, found someone new. one more girl who brings out the better in you. and i thought my heart was detached, from all the sunlight of our past, but she's so sweet, she's so pretty, does she mean you forgot about me? oh, i hope you're happy! but not like how you were with me, i'm selfish, i know, i can't let you go. so find someone great, but don't find no one better, i hope you're happy, but don't be happier. and do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen? an eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean! remember when i believed, you meant it when you said it first to me? and now i'm pickin' her apart, like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart. but she's beautiful, she looks kind, she probably gives you butterflies. ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah. i played dumb, but i always knew! that you talked to her, maybe did even worse. i kept quiet so i could keep you. and ain't it funny how you ran to her, the second that we called it quits? and ain't it funny how you said you were friends? now it sure as hell don't look like it! you betrayed me. and i know that you'll never feel sorry! for the way i hurt, yeah, you talked to her when we were together. loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter! it took you two weeks to go off and date her. guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor. now you bring her around just to shut me down! show her off like she's a new trophy. and i know if you were true, there's no damn way that you, could fall in love with somebody that quickly? i have nightmares each week 'bout that friday in may. one phone call from you and my entire world was changed. trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers. took everything i loved and crushed it in between your fingers! and i doubt you ever think about the damage that you did, but i hold onto every detail like my life depends on it, my undying love, now, i hold it like a grudge. and i hear your voice every time that i think i'm not enough, and i try to be tough, but i wanna scream, how could anybody do the things you did so easily? and i say i don't care, i say that i'm fine, but you know i can't let it go, i've tried, i've tried, i've tried for so long, it takes strength to forgive, but i don't feel strong. the arguments that i've won against you in my head. in the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed, yeah, i'm so tough when i'm alone, and i make you feel so guilty! and i fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry, and i try to understand why you would do this all to me, you must be insecure, you must be so unhappy. and i know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people, and we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal! lacy, the fourth track of guts, sees olivia blur the line between envy and homoeroticism. in one lens, rodrigo embraces her inferiority complex by personifying the beauty of women shes intimidated by in, lacy, oh lacy, skin like puff pastry. aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of hell?

'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive! you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'. so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time, as far as i'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn. and if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself, 'cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health. teardrops on my guitar illustrates the unrequited love taylor felt for classmate drew hardwick. taylor told fans that drew would often ask her for advice and date ideas for his girlfriend, and she would. drew looks at me, i fake a smile so he won't see. that i want and i'm needing. everything that we should be! i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about. and she's got everything that i have to live without! drew talks to me, i laugh 'cause it's just so funny. that i can't even see. anyone when he's with me. he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right. i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night. he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar. the only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star. he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do. drew walks by me, can he tell that i can't breathe? and there he goes, so perfectly, the kind of flawless i wish i could be. i don't know what i want, so don't ask me.

'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change. hoping it will end up in his pocket. but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain, oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay! it's not his price to pay. hold on, baby, you're losing it. the water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go. and no one knows, that you cry, but you don't tell anyone. that you might not be the golden one. and you're tied together with a smile, but you're coming undone, oh, oh, oh! cory's eyes are like a jungle. he smiles, it's like the radio. he whispers songs into my window. in words that nobody knows! there's pretty girls on every corner. they watch him as he's walking home. saying, \"does he know?\", will you ever know? you're beautiful, every little piece, love. don't you know you're really gonna be someone? ask anyone, and when you find everything you looked for! i hope your life leads you back to my door. oh, but if it don't! stay beautiful, cory finds another way to be. the highlight of my day. i'm taking pictures in my mind. so i can save 'em for a rainy day, it's hard to make a conversation. when he's taking my breath away? i should say, \"hey, by the way\". it's strange to think the songs we used to sing. the smiles, the flowers, everything is gone! yesterday, i found out about you! even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong. you say that you'd take it all back. given one chance, it was a moment of weakness. and you said yes, you should've said no, you should've gone home. you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go. you should've known that word. 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me. and i should've been there in the back of your mind, i shouldn't be asking myself why. you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet. you should've said no. baby, and you might still have me! you can see that i've been cryin'. and baby, you know all the right things to say, but do you honestly expect me to believe, we could ever be the same? she said i was seven and you were nine. i looked at you like the stars that shined. in the sky, the pretty lights, and our daddies used to joke about the two of us, growing up and falling in love. and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes, and said, \"oh, my, my, my\", take me back to the house in the backyard tree. said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me. you never did, you never did! take me back when our world was one block wide. i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried. just two kids, you and i. oh, my, my, my, my! well, i was sixteen when suddenly. i wasn't that little girl you used to see. but your eyes still shined like pretty lights, and our daddies used to joke about the two of us, they never believed we'd really fall in love! and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes, and said, \"oh, my, my, my\", i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone. in the front seat of his car, he's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel. the other on my heart. i look around, turn the radio down. he says, \"baby, is something wrong?\". i say, \"nothin', i was just thinkin' how we don't have a song\". and he says, our song is a slammin' screen door. sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window. when we're on the phone and you talk real slow? 'cause it's late and your mama don't know. our song is the way you laugh. the first date, \"man, i didn't kiss her and i should have\". and when i got home, 'fore i said \"amen\", askin' god if he could play it again. i was walking up the front porch steps. after everythin' that day, had gone all wrong and been trampled on? and lost and thrown away, got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed! i almost didn't notice all the roses. and the note that said, friday night beneath the stars. in a field behind your yard, you and i are painting pictures in the sky. and sometimes, we don't say a thing, just listen to the crickets sing. everything i need is right here by my side! and i know everything about you! i don't wanna live without you. i'm only up when you're not down. don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground? it's like no matter what i do. well, you drive me crazy half the time. the other half, i'm only tryin' to. let you know that what i feel is true! and i'm only me when i'm with you, just a small-town boy and girl. livin' in a crazy world. tryna figure out what is and isn't true. and i don't try to hide my tears, my secrets or my deepest fears. through it all, nobody gets me like you do! she can't see the way your eyes. light up when you smile. she'll never notice how you stop and stare! whenever she walks by? and you can't see me wanting you the way you want her, but you are everything to me! and i just wanna show you, she don't even know you. she's never gonna love you like i want to! and you just see right through me, but if you only knew me, we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable. instead of just invisible, oh, yeah, oh! there's a fire inside of you. that can't help but shine through. she's never gonna see the light! no matter what you do! it appears as the. why would you wanna break? a perfectly good heart? why would you wanna take? our love and tear it all apart now? why would you wanna make? the very first scar? why would you wanna break? a perfectly good heart? maybe i should've seen the signs. should've read the writing on the wall? and realized by the distance in your eyes, that i would be the one to fall. no matter what you say! i still can't believe that you would walk away. it don't make sense to me, but. why would you wanna break? a perfectly good heart? why would you wanna take? our love and tear it all apart now? why would you wanna make? the very first scar? why would you wanna break? a perfectly good heart? you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors. it's the mornin' of your very first day. you say \"hi\" to your friends you ain't seen in a while. try and stay out of everybody's way. it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here. for the next four years in this town, hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say. \"you know, i haven't seen you around before\". 'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you! you're gonna believe them, and when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out, well, count to ten, take it in. this is life before you know who you're gonna be. fifteen, you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail. and soon enough, you're best friends, laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool. we'll be outta here as soon as we can. and then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car, and you're feelin' like flyin', and your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one, and you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends, when the night ends? mmm-mm, mm-mm, mmm-mm, mm-mm, mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah, hey, stephen, i know looks can be deceiving. but i know i saw a light in you, and as we walked, we were talking, i didn't say half the things i wanted to. of all the girls tossing rocks at your window, i'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold. hey, stephen, boy, you might have me believing. i don't always have to be alone!
