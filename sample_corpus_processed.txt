Hello, it's me!
I was wondering if after all these years, you'd like to meet.
To go over everything!
They say that time's supposed to heal ya.
But I ain't done much healin',
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be.
When we were younger and free?
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet.
There's such a difference between us.
And a million miles,
Hello from the other side!
I must've called a thousand times.
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done!
But when I call, you never seem to be home!
Hello from the outside!
At least I can say that I've tried,
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart,
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore,
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry.
I hope that you're well.
Did you ever make it out of that town?
Where nothing ever happened?

It’s me saying, ‘Get the fuck….
There's a fire starting in my heart.
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare!
See how I'll leave with every piece of you.
Don't underestimate the things that I will do?
There's a fire starting in my heart.
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
The scars of your love remind me of us.
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless.
I can't help feeling.
We could've had it all.
Rolling in the deep,
You had my heart inside of your hand.
And you played it to the beat,
Baby, I have no story to be told!
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.

There ain't no gold in this river.
That I've been washin' my hands in forever!
I know there is hope in these waters.
But I can't bring myself to swim,
When I am drowning in this silence?
Baby, let me in!
Go easy on me, baby!
I was still a child.
Didn't get the chance to?
Feel the world around me.
I had no time to choose what I chose to do.
So go easy on me,
There ain't no room for things to change.
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways?
You can't deny how hard I've tried.
I changed who I was to put you both first.
But now I give up,
Go easy on mе, baby!
I was still a child.
Didn't get the chance to?
Feel thе world around me.
Had no time to choose what I chose to do?
So go easy on me,

I let it fall, my heart.
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
It was dark, and I was over.
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me.
My hands, they were strong.
But my knees were far too weak,
To stand in your arms,
Without falling to your feet,
But there's a side to you,
That I never knew, never knew!
All the things you'd say.
They were never true, never true!
And the games you'd play,
You would always win, always win!
But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face.
Well, it burned while I cried.
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name.
Your name,
When I lay with you?
I could stay there, close my eyes.
Feel you here forever!
You and me together, nothing is better!

I heard that you're settled down.
That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited.
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it,
I had hoped you'd see my face.
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over,
Never mind, I'll find someone like you!
I wish nothing but the best for you, too!
Don't forget me, I beg?
I remember you said.
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.
You know how the time flies.
Only yesterday was the time of our lives.
We were born and raised in a summer haze.
Bound by the surprise of our glory days.

Everybody loves the things you do.
From the way you talk to the way you move,
Everybody here is watching you.
'Cause you feel like home,
you're like a dream come true.
But, if by chance, you're here alone.
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long.
Hoping you're someone I used to know.
You look like a movie, you sound like a song.
My God, this reminds me of when we were young.
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time!
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised.
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless.
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song.
I was so scared to face my fears.
Nobody told me that you'd be here!
And I swear you'd moved overseas,
That's what you said when you left me.

I will leave my heart at the door.
I won't say a word.
They've all been said before, you know.
So why don't we just play pretend,
Like we're not scared of what is coming next.
Or scared of having nothing left?
Look, don't get me wrong.
I know there is no tomorrow.
All I ask is,
If this is my last night with you.
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend.
Give me a memory I can use.
Take me by the hand while we do.
What lovers do?
It matters how this ends.
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty.
It's already in your eyes.
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me,
No one knows me like you do!
And since you're the only one that mattered,
Tell me, who do I run to?

“Skyfall” is the theme song for the twenty-third James Bond film of the same name.
This is the end,
Hold your breath and count to ten.
Feel the Earth move, and then.
Hear my heart burst again.
For this is the end,
I've drowned and dreamt this moment.
So overdue, I owe them,
Swept away, I'm stolen,
Let the sky fall!
When it crumbles?
We will stand tall.
Face it all together,
Let the sky fall!
When it crumbles?
We will stand tall.
Face it all together at Skyfall.
At Skyfall,
Skyfall is where we start.
A thousand miles and poles apart.
Where worlds collide and days are dark?
You may have my number, you can take my name.
But you'll never have my heart!

Adele played guitar on the record, and it was this riff that began the song. She told the….
Just the guitar, okay, cool.
This was all you, none of it me.
You put your hands on, on my body and told me, mmm.
You told me you were ready.
For the big one, for the big jump,
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me, mmm.
That was what you told me.
I'm giving you up,
I've forgiven it all,
You set me free.
Send my love to your new lover.
Treat her better,
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts.
We both know we ain't kids no more.
Send my love to your new lover.
Treat her better,
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts.
We both know we ain't kids no more.

I built a house for a love to grow.
I was so young that it was hard to know.
I'm as lost now as I was back then.
Always make a mess of everything!
It's about time that I face myself.
All I do is bleed into someone else.
Painting walls with all my secret tears.
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears.
But, oh my,
Oh my!
I'll never learn if I never leap!
I'll always yearn if I never speak!
To be loved and love at the highest count,
Means to lose all the things I can't live without.
Let it be known that I will choose to lose!
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie.
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried!
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide.
I'll be the one to catch myself this time.
Tryna learn to lean into it all.
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing.
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning!
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by.
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right.

“I’m still just an…,
You were the shadow to my light.
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away.
Afraid our aim is out of sight.
Wanna see us alight,
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea.
Where are you now? Another dream?
The monster's running wild inside of me.
I'm faded, I'm faded,
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded,
So lost, I'm faded,
These shallow waters never met what I needed!
I'm letting go, a deeper dive.
Eternal silence of the sea.
I'm breathing, alive,

What's the trick? I wish I knew?
I'm so done with thinking through.
All the things I could've been.
And I know you wonder too,
All it takes is that one look you do.
And I run right back to you,
You crossed the line and it's time to say "F you".
What's the point in saying that?
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back.
But shit just don't work like that,
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad.
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that.
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever.
When it don't work out for the better?
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye.
When it all falls down, when it all falls down?
I'll be fine,
I'll be fine,
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad.
But I'll be fine,
[Verse 2: Juliander &,
Noah Cyrus!
Why we fight? I don't know?
We say what hurts the most.
Oh, I try!
staying cold, but you take it personal.
All these firing shots and making ground.
It's way too hard to cope.
, but I still,
can't let you go?

We're not in love,
We share no stories.
Just somethin' in your eyes.
Don't be afraid?
The shadows know me,
Let's leave the world behind!
Take me through the night.
Fall into the dark side.
We don't need the light.
We'll live on the dark side.
I see it, let's feel it.
While we're still young and fearless.
Let go of the light!
Fall into the dark side.
Fall into the dark side.
Give in to the dark side.
Let go of the light!
Fall into the dark side.

I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk.
I need a moment before I go, it's nothing personal!
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry.
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand.
So then, when I'm finished,
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world.
I'm taking my misery, make it my bitch.
Can't be everyone's favorite girl?
So take aim and fire away,
I've never been so wide awake!
No, nobody but me can keep me safe!
And I'm on my way,
The blood moon is on the rise.
The fire burning in my eyes.
No, nobody but me can keep me safe!
And I'm on my way,
Blep, yah, yah,
Farru,
Yah-yah-yah-yah,

Hello, sweet grief!
I know you'll be the death of me.
Feel like the mornin' after ecstasy.
I am drownin' in an endless sea.
Hello, old friend!
Here's the misery that knows no end.
So I'm doin' everything I can!
To make sure I never love again!
I wish that I did not know.
Where all broken lovers go?
I wish that my heart was made of stone.
Yeah, if I was bulletproof!
I'd love you black and blue.
If I was solid like a jewel.
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh.
I'd give you all my love.
If I was unbreakable,
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh.
You could shoot me with a gun of gold.
If I was unbreakable,

We were young, posters on the wall.
Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call.
We would stare at each other.
'Cause we were always in trouble!
And all the cool kids did their own thing.
I was on the outside always looking in!
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't!
They never really cared if I wasn't!
We all need that someone who gets you like no one else.
Right when you need it the most.
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on.
A friend through the highs and the lows.
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone.
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone.
Then I saw your face, your forgiving eyes.
Looking back at me from the other side.
Like you understood me,
And I'm never letting you go, oh!

Lost in your mind,
I wanna know.
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go!
If this night is not forever!
At least we are together,
I know I'm not alone.
I know I'm not alone.
Anywhere, whenever!
Apart, but still together,
I know I'm not alone.
I know I'm not alone.
I know I'm not alone.
I know I'm not alone.
Unconscious mind,
I'm wide awake,
Wanna feel one last time.
Take my pain away,

The song’s…,
Woah,
Eyes up, you've been gone for a fortnight.
My love, are you stuck in a fake life?
Can't win, if the prize is to waste your time?
Now it's wasting mine!
And I know that we're close, but I'm lonely,
Make me your only, won't win a trophy.
But can it kiss you like this when you hold me?
Missing it lowkey, I'll say it slowly.
It's me or the PS5.
Tell me how you wanna spend your night.
Three's feeling way too tight.
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over,
Me or the PS5,
Tell me which of us is more your type.
Seems like you can't decide.
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over,
Oh-oh!

I see those tears in your eyes.
I feel so helpless inside.
Oh love, there's no need to hide!
Just let me love you when your heart is tired.
Cold hands, red eyes,
Packed two bags at midnight.
They've been there for weeks.
You don't know what goodbye means.
Just roll up a cigarette.
Just forget about this mess.
I'm waiting on the sidelines.
From the sidelines,
I see those tears in your eyes.
And I feel so helpless inside,
Oh love, there's no need to hide!
Just let me love you when your heart is tired.
If your ghost pulls you apart.
And it feels like you've lost who you are,
My love, there's no need to hide.
Just let me love you when your heart is tired.

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah!
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah!
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world.
Y-y-y-you think you're so small like you're itty-bitty.
Just one match in the lights of the city.
Walkin' by strangers on the side of the street.
Like a quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like.
You think you're never gonna make your mark!
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like.
Out of sight, out of m-m-m-mind, like.
Like it's just a waste of time, like-like-like.
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, yeah, yeah,
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world.
I said.
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, yeah, yeah,
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls.
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah!
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah!
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world.

Hey,
I know what I came to do.
And that ain't gonna change,
So go ahead and talk your talk,
'Cause I won't take the bait.
I'm over here doin' what I like.
I'm over here workin' day and night.
And if my real ain't real enough,
I'm sorry for you, babe.
Let's find a light inside our universe now!
Where ain't nobody keep on holdin' us down?
Just come and get it, let them say what they say.
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, woo.
[Chorus: Jamie Foxx &,
Ariana Grande,
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo.
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo.
Focus on me (,
Focus,
), f-f-focus on me, woo (.
Focus on me,
Focus on me (,
Focus,
), f-f-focus on me, woo (.
Focus on me,
I can tell you're curious.
It's written on your lips.
Ain't no need to hold it back.
Go 'head and talk your shit!
I know you're hopin' that I'll react.
I know you're hopin' I'm lookin' back.
But if my real ain't real enough,
Then I don't know what is.

Oh, yeah!
Don't need permission?
Made my decision to test my limits.
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness.
Start what I finished,
Don't need no hold up?
Taking control of this kind of moment.
I'm locked and loaded,
Completely focused, my mind is open.
All that you got,
Skin to skin, oh my God.
Don't you stop, boy?
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman.
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you.
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't.
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout.
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and!
Know what I'm doing,
The way we're movin',
Like introducing us to a new thing.
I wanna savor, save it for later.
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver.
It's only nature, I live for danger.

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles!
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble.
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines.
Buy myself all of my favorite things.
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch.
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings.
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah.
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy.
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'.
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it.
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it.
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it.
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it.
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it.
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it.
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs.".
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches.
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches.
Think retail therapy my new addiction.
Whoever said money can't solve your problems.
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em.
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em".
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms.

Thought I'd end up with Sean.
But he wasn't a match,
Wrote some songs about Ricky.
Now I listen and laugh!
Even almost got married,
And for Pete, I'm so thankful,
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm.
'Cause he was an angel.
One taught me love,
One taught me patience,
And one taught me pain,
Now, I'm so amazing!
Say I've loved and I've lost.
But that's not what I see,
So, look what I got.
Look what you taught me.
And for that, I say,
Thank you, next,
Thank you, next,
Thank you, next,
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex.
Thank you, next,
Thank you, next,
Thank you, next,
I'm so fuckin'—,

You got me some type of way.
Ain't used to feelin' this way.
I do not know what to say.
But I know I shouldn't think about it,
Took one fuckin' look at your face.
Now I wanna know how you taste!
Usually don't give it away.
But you know I'm already thinkin' 'bout it,
Then I realize she's right there.
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair",
Break up with your girlfriend.
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored!
You could hit it in the mornin'.
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours!
I know it ain't right, but I don't care.
Break up with your girlfriend.
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored!
This shit always happen to me!
Why can't we just play for keeps?
Practically on my knees,
But I know I shouldn't think about it,
You know what you're doin' to me.
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah.
Actin' all innocent, please,
When I know you already thinkin' 'bout it?

Mmm,
Hey, yeah,
I'm stuck with you,
I'm not one to stick around.
One strike and you're out, baby.
Don't care if I sound crazy?
But you never let me down, no, no!
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'.
Still layin' in your bed, singin'.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Got all this time on our hands!
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah.
I could stay here for a lifetime.
So, lock the door and throw out the key.
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me?
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do,
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you.
So, go ahead and drive me insane.
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change!
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you.
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby.

I didn't ask for a free ride.
I only asked you to show me a real good time.
I never asked for the rainfall!
At least I showed up, you showed me nothin' at all,
It's comin' down on me.
Water like misery,
It's comin' down on me.
I'm ready, rain on me.
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive.
Rain on me, rain, rain.
Rain on me, rain, rain.
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive.
Rain on me, rain, rain.
Rain on me,
[Drop: Lady Gaga,
Ariana Grande,
Rain on me,
Mm, oh yeah, baby,
Rain on me,
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent.
Oh, but at least we try, mm!
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in!
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah,

Heaven sent you to me.
I'm just hopin’ I don't repeat history.
Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday.
Then make a lotta love on a Monday.
Never need no , no one else, babe!
’Cause I'll be,
Switchin' them positions for you.
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom.
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops.
Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do.
That I won't do, switchin’ for you.
Perfect, perfect,
You're too good to be true.
But I get tired of runnin', fuck it,
Now, I’m runnin' with you!
Said, boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday.
Then make a lotta love on a Monday.
Never need no , no onе else, babe!
'Causе I'll be,

In case you haven't noticed,
Well, everybody's tired,
And healin' from somebody!
Or somethin' we don't see just right,
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on.
Come on and walk this way through the fire!
And if you find yourself in a dark situation,
Just turn on your light and be like.
"Yes, and?",
Say that shit with your chest, and.
Be your own fuckin' best friend.
Say that shit with your chest.
Keep moving like, "What's next?".
"Yes, and?",
Now, I'm so done with caring!
What you think, no, I won't hide?
Underneath your own projections,
Or change my most authentic life,

You, you love it how I move you.
You love it how I touch you, my one.
When all is said and done?
You'll believe God is a woman.
And I, I feel it after midnight,
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one.
It lingers when we're done.
You'll believe God is a woman.
I don't wanna waste no time, yeah.
Have it any way you like, yeah?
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it,
Ain't nobody else can relate!
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid.
Baby, lay me down and let's pray!
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it.
And I can be all the things you told me not to be,
When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing?
And he see the universe when I'm the company,
It's all in me,

[Intro: Ariana Grande &,
Nicki Minaj,
I've been here all night.
I've been here all day.
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side.
I'm talkin' to ya,
See you standing over there with your body.
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body.
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin',
I'm comin' at ya,
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation.
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation?
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin',
These friends keep talkin' way too much.
Say I should give you up.
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I—?
I've been here all night.
I've been here all day.
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side.
I've been here all night.
I've been here all day.
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side.

Right now, I'm in a state of mind.
I wanna be in like all the time.
Ain't got no tears left to cry.
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up.
I'm lovin', I'm livin' , I'm pickin' it up.
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up.
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up.
I'm pickin' it up , pickin' it up.
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up.
Yeah, we turnin' it up!
Ain't got no tears in my body.
I ran out, but, boy, I like it.
I like it, I like it.
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it?
We out here vibin'.
We vibin', we vibin'.
Comin' out,
Even when it's rainin' down.
Can't stop now?
Can't stop so shut your mouth?
Shut your mouth,
And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe,
Know it, babe, yeah,

Hmm,
You might think I'm crazy.
The way I've been cravin'.
If I put it quite plainly.
Just gimme them babies,
So what you doin' tonight?
Better say, "Doin' you right".
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight.
I don't wanna keep you up.
But show me, can you keep it up?
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up.
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy!
I've been drinkin' coffee,
And I've been eatin' healthy,
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah.
Savin' up my energy,
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight!
Thirty-four, thirty-five,
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight!
Thirty-four, thirty-five,

I think a lot….
​​lacigam gnihtemos od oT,
​​thgin laiceps ruoy s'thginot tuB.
Some days, things just take.
Way too much of my energy.
I look up and the whole room's spinning.
You take my cares away.
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate.
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'.
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm.
Time goes by and I can't control my mind.
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time?
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'.
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin',
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'.
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm,
Sometimes, it's hard to find.
Find my way up into the clouds.
Tune it out, they can be so loud.
You remind me of a time.
When things weren't so complicated?
All I need is to see your face.

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire.
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest.
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you.
I should've done you better 'cause you don't want a liar.
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything!
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you.
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything!
But I got nothin' here without you,
So, one last time,
I need to be the one who takes you home.
One more time,
I promise after that, I'll let you go.
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart!
All I really care is you wake up in my arms.
One last time,
I need to be the one who takes you home.
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it.
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it,
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily?
I know that this is my fault, I should've been more careful.

I've been watchin' you for some time.
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes?
Burning cities and napalm skies.
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes.
Your ocean eyes,
No fair!
You really know how to make me cry.
When you give me those ocean eyes?
I'm scared,
I've never fallen from quite this high!
Fallin' into your ocean eyes.
Those ocean eyes,
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind.
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind?
Careful creature made friends with time.
He left her lonely with a diamond mind.
And those ocean eyes,
No fair!
You really know how to make me cry.
When you give me those ocean eyes?
I'm scared,
I've never fallen from quite this high!
Fallin' into your ocean eyes.
Those ocean eyes,

Help, I lost myself again.
But I remember you,
Don't come back, it won't end well?
But I wish you'd tell me to,
Our love is six feet under.
I can't help but wonder.
If our grave was watered by the rain.
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch.
It's all too much for me.
Blow away like smoke in air.
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under.
I can't help but wonder.
If our grave was watered by the rain.
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose.
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes.
Creepin' around like no one knows.
Think you're so criminal,
Bruises on both my knees for you.
Don't say thank you or please?
I do what I want when I'm wanting to.
My soul? So cynical,
So you're a tough guy,
Like it really rough guy.
Just can't get enough guy.
Chest always so puffed guy!
I'm that bad type,
Make your mama sad type.
Make your girlfriend mad tight.
Might seduce your dad type.
I'm the bad guy,
Duh,
I'm the bad guy,
I like it when you take control.
Even if you know that you don't.
Own me, I'll let you play the role.
I'll be your animal,
My mommy likes to sing along with me.
She'll pity the men I know.

I should have known.
I'd leave alone,
Just goes to show,
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe.
We were a pair,
But I saw you there,
Too much to bear,
You were my life, but life is far away from fair.
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie.
You were never on my side!
Fool me once, fool me twice.
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry!
There's just no time to die.
I let it burn.
You're no longer my concern, mmm.
Faces from my past return.
Another lesson yet to learn.

I had a dream.
I got everything I wanted!
Not what you'd think!
And if I'm bein' honest,
It might've been a nightmare.
To anyone who might care.
Thought I could fly,
So I stepped off the Golden, mm,
Nobody cried!
Nobody even noticed!
I saw them standing right there.
Kinda thought they might care.
I had a dream.
I got everything I wanted!
But when I wake up, I see,
You with me.
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you,
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to?
If I could change the way that you see yourself.
You wouldn't wonder why you hear.
'They don't deserve you'",

When I'm away from you?
I'm happier than ever,
Wish I could explain it better.
I wish it wasn't true.
Give me a day or two to think of something clever.
To write myself a letter,
To tell me what to do, mm-mm,
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through?
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to.
Be cool about what I was tellin' you.
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do.
And I'd end up more afraid,
Don't say it isn't fair?
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable.
So if you really wanna know,
When I'm away from you?
I'm happier than ever,
Wish I could explain it better.
I wish it wasn't true.
, mm-mm,

I don't wanna talk right now.
I just wanna watch TV.
I'll stay in the pool and drown.
So I don't have to watch you leave,
I put on.
Survivor,
just to watch somebody suffer!
Maybe I should get some sleep.
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other.
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again.
That's what happens when you fall in love.
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind.
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love".
Don't know where you are right now?
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself.
Just because you're mad at me.
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while,
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial.
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade.

Sometimes, you look the same.
Just like you did before the accident.
When you're starin' into space?
It's hard to believe you don't remember it.
Woke up in the ambulance.
You pieced it all together on the drive.
I know you don't remember calling me.
But I told you even then you looked so pretty,
In a hospital bed, I remember you said,
You were scared.
And so was I,
In a standstill on the 5,
Thought it was unusually early traffic.
Usually, I don't panic,
I just wanted to be on time.
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder?
I didn't even think of pullin' over.
I pieced it all together late that night.
And I know you don't remember calling me,
But I told you even then you looked so pretty,
In a hospital bed, I remember you said,
You were scared.
And so was I,

I used to float, now I just fall down.
I used to know, but I'm not sure now.
What I was made for?
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal.
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real.
Just somethin' you paid for.
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I,
I don't know how to feel.
But I wanna try,
I don't know how to feel.
But someday, I might,
Someday, I might,
Mm, mm, ah,
Mm, mm, mm,
When did it end? All the enjoyment?
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend.
It's not what he's made for.
What was I made for?

Oh, mm-mm!
I could eat that girl for lunch.
Yeah, she dances on my tongue!
Tastes like she might be the one.
And I could never get enough!
I could buy her so much stuff.
It's a craving, not a crush, huh.
"Call me when you're there".
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare.
And I left it under 'Claire'",
So now, she's comin' up the stairs,
So I'm pullin' up a chair,
And I'm puttin' up my hair,
Baby, I think you were made for me!
Somebody write down the recipe!
Been tryin' hard not to overeat.
You're just so sweet,
I'll run a shower for you like you want.
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on.
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off.
Huh,

To take my love away,
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name.
Not today, not tomorrow!
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow,
I got change , you could borrow.
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow!
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more.
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store.
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
Did you take?
My love away,
From me? Me,
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away.
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face.
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break".
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

I want you to stay.
'Til I'm in the grave.
'Til I rot away, dead and buried.
'Til I'm in the casket you carry.
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh.
'Cause it was always you!
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me,
Nothin' left to lose without my baby!
Birds of a feather, we should stick together.
, I know,
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone!
Can't change the weather, might not be forever?
But if it's forever, it's even better!
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for,
I don't think I could love you more.
It might not be long, but baby, I.
I'll love you 'til the day that I die.
'Til the day that I die.
'Til the light leaves my eyes.
'Til the day that I die.

I wish you the best for the rest of your life.
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes.
But I need to confess, I told you a lie,
I said you.
You were the love of my life.
The love of my life.
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you.
Then you tried to break mine.
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology.
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave,
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me!
Then you moved on immediately.
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life,
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes.
But I need to confess, I told you a lie,
When I said you?
You  were the love of my life.
The love of my life.

Uh-uh,
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear.
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there.
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south.
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about.
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south.
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about.
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it.
Pull it to the side and get all up in it.
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it.
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it.
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it.
Pull it to the side and get all up in it.
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it.
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious.
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear?
Already know what you've got goin' on down there.
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows.
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo.
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out.
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about.

The…,
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish &.
Khalid,
Thought I found a way.
Thought I found a way out (.
Found,
But you never go away (!
Never go away!
So I guess I gotta stay now,
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here!
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear.
[Chorus: Billie Eilish,
with Khalid,
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone.
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone.
Hello, welcome home!
[Verse 2: Khalid,
with Billie Eilish,
Walking out of time,
Looking for a better place.
Something's on my mind,
Always in my head space!
But I know someday I'll make it out of here,
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear.

Things fall apart,
And time breaks your heart,
I wasn't there, but I know.
She was your girl.
You showed her the world.
But fell out of love and you both let go,
She was cryin’ on my shoulder.
All I could do was hold her.
Only made us closer until July.
Now, I know that you love me!
You don't need to remind me.
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time,
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign.
Did I cross the line?
Hmm,
Well, good things don't last.
And life moves so fast,
I'd never ask who was better!
'Cause she couldn't be,
More different from me,
Happy and free in leather.

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to.
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'.
But nothin' ever stops you leavin',
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own.
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me.
Call me friend, but keep me closer.
And I'll call you when the party's over,
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own.
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that,
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that!
But nothin' is better sometimes,
Once we've both said our goodbyes.
Let's just let it go!
Let me let you go!

Ba-da-da-da-da,
Ba-da-da-da-da,
Don't be that way?
Fall apart twice a day.
I just wish you could feel what you say.
Show, never tell!
But I know you too well,
Got a mood that you wish you could sell!
If teardrops could be bottled.
There'd be swimming pools filled by models.
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore".
f "I love you" was a promise.
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before.
I don't wanna be you.
Anymore,
Hands getting cold,
Losing feeling is getting old.
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake,
We've made every mistake,
Only you know the way that I break.

It's not true,
Tell me I’ve been lied to.
Crying isn't like you, ooh.
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to!
Let someone see right through, ooh!
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh.
And nothing has to change today!
You didn’t mean to say "I love you".
I love you and I don't want to, ooh.
Up all night on another red-eye.
I wish we never learned to fly!
Maybe we should just try.
To tell ourselves a good lie,
Didn't mean to make you cry?
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh.
And nothing has to change today!
You didn't mean to say "I love you".
I love you and I don't want to, ooh.

Billie,
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish &.
Mehki Raine,
Come here!
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly.
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly.
The way I'm drinkin' you down.
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me.
Step on the glass, staple your tongue.
Bury a friend, try to wake up.
Cannibal class, killing the son?
Bury a friend, I wanna end me.
I wanna end me.
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me.
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna….

I've been watchin' you for some time.
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes?
Burning cities and napalm skies.
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes.
Your ocean eyes,
No fair!
You really know how to make me cry.
When you give me those ocean eyes?
I'm scared,
I've never fallen from quite this high!
Fallin' into your ocean eyes.
Those ocean eyes,
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind.
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind?
Careful creature made friends with time.
He left her lonely with a diamond mind.
And those ocean eyes,
No fair!
You really know how to make me cry.
When you give me those ocean eyes?
I'm scared,
I've never fallen from quite this high!
Fallin' into your ocean eyes.
Those ocean eyes,

Help, I lost myself again.
But I remember you,
Don't come back, it won't end well?
But I wish you'd tell me to,
Our love is six feet under.
I can't help but wonder.
If our grave was watered by the rain.
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch.
It's all too much for me.
Blow away like smoke in air.

I don't think I could love you more.
It might not be long, but baby, I.
I'll love you 'til the day that I die.
'Til the day that I die.
'Til the light leaves my eyes.
'Til the day that I die.

I wish you the best for the rest of your life.
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes.
But I need to confess, I told you a lie,
I said you.
You were the love of my life.
The love of my life.
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you.
Then you tried to break mine.
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology.
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave,
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me!
Then you moved on immediately.
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life,
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes.
But I need to confess, I told you a lie,
When I said you?
You  were the love of my life.
The love of my life.

Uh-uh,
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear.
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there.
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south.
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about.
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south.
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about.
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it.
Pull it to the side and get all up in it.
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it.
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it.
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it.
Pull it to the side and get all up in it.
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it.
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious.
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear?
Already know what you've got goin' on down there.
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows.
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo.
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out.
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about.

Thought I found a way.
Thought I found a way out (.
Found,
But you never go away (!
Never go away!
So I guess I gotta stay now,
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here!
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear.
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone.
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone.
Hello, welcome home!
Walking out of time,
Looking for a better place.
Something's on my mind,
Always in my head space!
But I know someday I'll make it out of here,
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear.

Things fall apart,
And time breaks your heart,
I wasn't there, but I know.
She was your girl.
You showed her the world.
But fell out of love and you both let go,
She was cryin’ on my shoulder.
All I could do was hold her.
Only made us closer until July.
Now, I know that you love me!
You don't need to remind me.
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time,
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign.
Did I cross the line?
Hmm,
Well, good things don't last.
And life moves so fast,
I'd never ask who was better!
'Cause she couldn't be,
More different from me,
Happy and free in leather.

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to.
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'.
But nothin' ever stops you leavin',
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own.
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me.
Call me friend, but keep me closer.
And I'll call you when the party's over,
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own.
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that,
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that!
But nothin' is better sometimes,
Once we've both said our goodbyes.
Let's just let it go!
Let me let you go!

Ba-da-da-da-da,
Ba-da-da-da-da,
Don't be that way?
Fall apart twice a day.
I just wish you could feel what you say.
Show, never tell!
But I know you too well,
Got a mood that you wish you could sell!
If teardrops could be bottled.
There'd be swimming pools filled by models.
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore".
f "I love you" was a promise.
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before.
I don't wanna be you.
Anymore,
Hands getting cold,
Losing feeling is getting old.
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake,
We've made every mistake,
Only you know the way that I break.

It's not true,
Tell me I’ve been lied to.
Crying isn't like you, ooh.
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to!
Let someone see right through, ooh!
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh.
And nothing has to change today!
You didn’t mean to say "I love you".
I love you and I don't want to, ooh.
Up all night on another red-eye.
I wish we never learned to fly!
Maybe we should just try.
To tell ourselves a good lie,
Didn't mean to make you cry?
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh.
And nothing has to change today!
You didn't mean to say "I love you".
I love you and I don't want to, ooh.

Billie,
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish &.
Mehki Raine,
Come here!
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly.
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly.
The way I'm drinkin' you down.
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me.
Step on the glass, staple your tongue.
Bury a friend, try to wake up.
Cannibal class, killing the son?
Bury a friend, I wanna end me.
I wanna end me.
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me.
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna….

I might.
Empty my bank account,
And buy that boy with a pipe,
Buy that boy with a pipe.
I might, I might.
Empty my bank account,
And buy that boy with a pipe,
Buy that boy with a pipe.
I might.
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the slide.
Whatever comes, comes through clear?
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side.
And whatever comes, comes through clear,
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark.
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far.
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms.
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms.
Layin', we're still a link apart.
It's like we could die here all young.
Like we could dye hair all blonde, huh.
If we could see in twenty twin.
Twice we could see it 'til the end.

Hey!
Now nothing ever last forever, no!
One minute you're here and the next you're gone.
So I respect you, wanna take it slow,
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe.
And do you mind if I steal a kiss?
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me,
The way you move it here.
Just wanna feel it from you.
Don't be afraid to catch feels?
Ride drop top and chase thrills.
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills.
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels!
Feels with me,
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh.
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality.
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar.
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity.

Ah-ooh, ooh, ah-ooh,
I want you to breathe me in.
Let me be your air!
Let me roam your body freely!
No inhibition, no fear!
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?
Hit me harder again,
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer again,
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh,
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh,

Are you drunk enough?
Not to judge what I'm doin’?
Are you high enough?
To excuse that I'm ruined? 'Cause I’m ruined,
Is it late enough?
For you to come and stay over?
'Cause we're free to love.
So tease me, ooh,
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings.
But I'll give you everything
Tonight,
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here.
So come get your everything
Tonight,
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings.
But I'll give you everything
Tonight,
Magic is in the air, there ain’t no science here.
So come get your everything
Tonight,
Tonight,
Your everything tonight, uh!
Is it loud enough?
’Cause my body is callin' for ya, callin’ for ya.
I need someone.
To do the things that I do, mhm,
I'm heatin' up,
Energy's takin’ control,
I'm speedin' up,
My heartbeat's dancin' alone,

When I met you in the summer?
To my heartbeat's sound,
We fell in love.
As the leaves turned brown.
And we could be together, baby,
As long as skies are blue.
You act so innocent now.
But you lied so soon,
When I met you in the summer?
When I met you in the summer?
To my heartbeat's sound,
We fell in love.
As the leaves turned brown.
And we could be together, baby,
As long as skies are blue.
You act so innocent now.
But you lied so soon,
When I met you in the summer?
Summer,

I've been rollin' on the freeway.
I've been riding 85,
I've been thinking way too much.
And I'm way too gone to drive,
I've got anger in my chest.
I've got millions on my mind.
And you didn't fit the picture,
So I guess you weren't the vibe,
I've been rollin' on the freeway.
I've been riding 85,
I've been thinking way too much.
And I'm way too gone to drive,
I've got anger in my chest.

So I guess you weren't the vibe,
Got L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci!
Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci!
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn.
They deserve Whammys, they imposters.
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe.
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe.
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah.

Baby, this is what you came for!
Lightning strikes every time she moves.
And everybody's watchin' her,
But she's lookin' at,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh.

Who knows why it's gotta be this way.
We say nothin' more than we need.
I say, "Your place" when we leave.
Baby, this is what you came for!
Lightning strikes every time she moves.
And everybody's watchin' her,

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf.
Now when I lean on you and I got nothin' left!
Hey, I've been wantin' to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry.
Same old fucking story everybody sing.
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar,
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it.
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it.
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you cryin'.
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby.
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby.
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby.

Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else!
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself.

Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya.
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell.

'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature.
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold.
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows.
But so it go,
Come live all your dreams out at OVO!
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes.
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe.
No woman ever had me star-struck!
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up,
I’m charged up,
Oh no, we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us!
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us.
I'm charged up,

Oh man!
Oh man, oh man!
Not again!
Yeah!
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me!
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message.
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon.
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97.
Woah—very important and very pretentious.
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention?
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience!
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options!
I wanna see my niggas go insane.
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame.
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne.
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way.
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB.
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad.
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap,
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up.
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs.
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough.
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch.
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her.
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her.
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more.
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers!
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga!
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas.
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas,
Make sure you hit him with the prenup.
Then tell that man to ease up.
I did another one, I did another one.
You still ain't did shit about the other one.

Another key subject of the song is….
And they wishin' and wishin',
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me,
Yeah!
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me.
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me.
Don't pull up at 6 a.m. to cuddle with me?
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me.
I don't wanna die for them to miss me.
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me!
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me.
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me.
God's plan, God's plan!
I hold back, sometimes, I won't, yeah.
I feel good, sometimes, I don't.
I finessed down Weston Road.
Might go down a G-O-D.
I go hard on Southside G.
I make sure that north-side eat.
And still,
Bad things,
It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'.
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me,
Bad things,
It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'.
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me,
Yeah, ayy, ayy!

Trap, TrapMoneyBenny,
This shit got me in my feelings.
Gotta be real with it, yeah!
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me!
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya.
And I'm down for you always!
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me!
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya.
And I'm down for you always!
Look, the new me is really still the real me.
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me.
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options.
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'.
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin',
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it,
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it,
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it.
TrapMoneyBenny, ayy,
I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny.
From the block like you Jenny,
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many.

You used to call me on my.
You used to, you used to.
Yeah!
You used to call me on my cell phone.
Late-night when you need my love.
Call me on my cell phone.
Late-night when you need my love.
And I know when that hotline bling,
That can only mean one thing.
I know when that hotline bling.
That can only mean one thing.
Ever since I left the city, you.
Got a reputation for yourself now!
Everybody knows and I feel left out.
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out.
'Cause ever since I left the city, you.
Started wearin' less and goin' out more.
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor.
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before!
You used to call me on my cell phone.
Late-night when you need my love.
Call me on my cell phone.
Late-night when you need, my love.
I know when that hotline bling.
That can only mean one thing.
I know when that hotline bling.
That can only mean one thing.

Baby, I like your style!
Grips on your waist, front way, back way.
You know that I don't play.
Streets not safe but I never run away!
Even when I'm away,
Oti, oti,
There's never much love when we go OT!
I pray to make it back in one piece.
I pray, I pray.
That's why I need a one dance.
Got a Hennessy in my hand!
One more time 'fore I go.
Higher powers taking a hold on me.
I need a one dance.
Got a Hennessy in my hand!
One more time 'fore I go.
Higher powers taking a hold on me.
Baby, I like your style!

I got my eyes on you.
You're everything that I see!
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly.
I can't get over you.
You left your mark on me.
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly.
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it.
You act so different around me.
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it.
I know exactly who you could be.
Just hold on, we're going home.
Just hold on, we're going home.
It's hard to do these things alone.
Just hold on, we're going home.
Home,
I got my eyes on you.
You're everything that I see!
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly.
I can't get over you.
You left your mark on me.
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly.

Hol' it yute, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it.
No sleepin' in the streets!
Shaky warrior,
Yeah, this that Oliver, 40, Niko shit man!
15 Fort York shit, y'know?
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah!
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes.
Countin' money, you know how it goes.
Pray the real live forever, man!
Pray the fakes get exposed.
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve.
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt.
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose.
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it.
I don't like how serious they take themselves.
I've always been me, I guess I know myself!
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that.
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that.
This been where you find me at.
That's been where you find me at.
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling.
He put me on to the finer things.
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans?
I had a yellow TechnoMarine.
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks.
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback.
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags.
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes.

‘New Love’ might sound like a classic tale of unrequited love. 
A fool that continues to go down the path of heartbreak, 
in the knowledge that they are fighting a losing game. 
But at the time I was writing….
Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue!
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth,
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth.
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do,
I don't wanna waste no time all alone.
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own!
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore.
And I've been through mountains and seas,
Tryna get you to come back to me.
And I've been far, and I've been so deep,
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe!
And I need some new love,
New love, new love,
Even though I've run away, I still come back.
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said!
I've been trying to explain the things we had.
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad,

I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon.
Oh, when you're looking at the sun!
You're not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool.
No, you're not fooling anyone!
Oh, but when you're gone, when you're gone, when you're gone!
Oh, baby, all the lights go out!
Thinking now that maybe I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong.
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out!
Oh, baby, come on, let me get to know you!
Just another chance so that I can show.
That I won't let you down and run.
No, I won't let you down and run!
'Cause I could be the one.
I could be the one.
I could be the one.
I could be the one.
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue.
Oh, when you see everything in red!
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you, do for you, do for you!
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head!

The song was released as….
He calls me the devil.
I make him wanna sin.
Every time I knock,
He can't help but let me in.
Must be homesick for the real.
I'm the realest it gets.
You'd probably still adore me.
With my hands around your neck,
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah?
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol.
Where I'm coming from, yeah?
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb.
'Cause we're hot like hell.
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself,
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven.
And I'll give it to you,
Hotter than hell,
Hotter than hell,

I know it's hot.
I know we've got.
Something that money can't buy.
Fighting in fits,
Biting your lip,
Loving till late in the night.
Tell me I'm too crazy.
You can't tame me, can't tame me.
Tell me I have changed.
But I'm the same me, oh, same me,
Inside,
If you don't like the way I talk.
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock.
Then finish your glass of wine.
We fight and we argue.
You'll still love me blind.
If we don't fuck this whole thing up.
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah.
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign,
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah.
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign,
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah.

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy.
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me.
My love,
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else!
But my love,
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself.
One, don't pick up the phone.
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone.
Two, don't let him in.
You'll have to kick him out again.
Three, don't be his friend.
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'.
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him,
I got new rules, I count 'em.
I got new rules, I count 'em.
I gotta tell them to myself.
I got new rules, I count 'em.
I gotta tell them to myself.

You call me all friendly.
Tellin' me how much you miss me.
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs.
Well, I'm too busy for your business.
Go find a girl who wants to listen!
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong.
So I cut you off,
I don't need your love.
'Cause I already cried enough.
I've been done,
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye.
I cut you off.
I don't need your love.
So you can try all you want,
Your time is up, I'll tell you why.
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now.
So save it, get gone, shut up,
'Cause if you think I care about you now.
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck.
I remember that weekend.
When my best friend caught you creepin'?
You blamed it all on the alcohol.
So, I made my decision.
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it.
Play the victim and switch your position.
I'm through, I'm done,

One kiss is all it takes.
Fallin' in love with me.
Possibilities,
I look like all you need.
Let me take the night, I love real easy!
And I know that you'll still wanna see me,
On the Sunday morning, music real loud,
Let me love you while the moon is still out!
Something in you-ou-ou,
Lit up heaven in me-e-e.
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep.
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel.
One kiss is all it takes.
Fallin' in love with me.
Possibilities,
I look like all you need.
One kiss is all it takes.
Fallin' in love with me.
Possibilities,
I look like all you need.

If you don't wanna see me.
Did a full one-eighty, crazy?
Thinking 'bout the way I was.
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe?
But look at where I ended up,
I'm all good already,
So moved on, it's scary,
I'm not where you left me at all, so.
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody!
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me.
Don't show up, don't come out?
Don't start caring about me now?
Walk away, you know how.
Don't start caring about me now?
Aren't you the guy who tried to?
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you.
I'm better on the other side.

The song fits perfectly with….
Common love isn't for us.
We created something phenomenal.
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich.
Nothing on this planet compares to it!
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
All night, I'll riot with you.
I know you got my back and you know I got you.
So come on , come on , come on,
Let's get physical!
Lights out, follow the noise.
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice!
So come on , come on , come on,
Let's get physical!
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in.
Love the simulation we're dreaming in!
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life.
'Cause this one's pretty nice.
Living it up,

It was….
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye!
Had to love and lose a hundred million times?
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like?
Now I'm falling!
You say my name like I have never heard before!
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure.
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all.
Are you falling?
Centre of attention,
You know you can get whatever you want from me.
Whenever you want it, baby?
It's you in my reflection.
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me.
If I would've known it, baby.
I would've stayed at home.
'Cause I was doing better alone.
But when you said, "Hello",
I knew that was the end of it all.
I should've stayed at home.
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go.
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone!
But when you said, "Hello",
I knew that was the end of it all.
I should've stayed at home.
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go.
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Bad Bunny,
You know that sometimes I think about us now and then.
But I never wanna fall again, ah!
Yo no te quisiera olvidar.
Eh-eh,
Pero contigo es todo o na'.
-eh,
Yeah-yeah!
You're deep in the water, yeah, you're drownin' us.
You question my love like it's not enough.
But I hate that you know, you know, you know,
You got me tied up.
You regret it now, but it's your mistake.
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know,
You know you messed up.
One day you'll love me again.
One day you'll love me for sure.
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'.
Baby, you'll knock at my door!
One day you'll love me again.
Hug me again till the end.
One day you'll beg me to try.
One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover.
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend.

It was great at the very start.
Hands on each other,
Couldn't stand to be far apart?
Closer the better,
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors!
Magnifying all our flaws,
And I wonder why, wonder what for,
Why we keep coming back for more?
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight?
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight?
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch.
Forgot how it feels,

If you wanna,
run away with me, I know a galaxy.
And I can take you for a ride,
I had a premonition that we.
fell into,
a rhythm,
Where the music don't stop for life?
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes.
Shining just the way I like.
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company.
You met me at the perfect time.
You want me, I want you, baby.
My sugarboo, I'm levitating,
The Milky Way, we're renegading.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight.
I need you all night, come on, dance with me.
I'm levitating,
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (.
You're the,
moonlight,
I need you all night, come on, dance with me.
I'm levitating,
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy.
I see us written in the stars.
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never!
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far!
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes.
Shining just the way we are.
I feel like we're forever every time we get together!
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars,

We haven't talked all morning.
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall.
I'm scared, I'm falling,
Losing all, losing all my control.
And I'm tired of talking,
Feel myself saying the same old things.
But this love's important,
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way?

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.
Feel like we about to break up.
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time.
Touch me like you touch nobody!
Put your hands all up on me.
Tired of hearing sorry,
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up.
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me.
Tired of hearing sorry,
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up.
Kiss, kiss and make up.
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up.
Kiss, kiss and make up.
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up.

Listen, little lady,
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday.
You work late, you was with a perv makin' dirty fake love in his Mercedes.
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night.
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try.
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night,
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry.
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for.
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw.
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure.
They'll know you're fibbin' if you tell them you got hit by a door.
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothin' but a dumb hooker,
Medical attention could be fatal 'cause the cunt wouldn't.
Ever let a doctor near someone that's gettin' dough for him.
Cause next you got poxy authorities stickin' their noses in.
She's just under the upper hand.
And goes mad for a couple grams,
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight,
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland.
And sell love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
For angels to fly,

White lips, pale face,
Breathin' in the snowflakes,
Burnt lungs, sour taste,
Light's gone, days end,
Struggling to pay rent,
Long nights, strange men,
And they say,
She's in the Class A Team.
Stuck in her daydream,
Been this way since eighteen.
but lately,
Her face seems,
Slowly sinking, wasting,
Crumbling like pastries,
And they scream,
"The worst things in life come free to us".
'Cause we're just under the upper hand.
And go mad for a couple grams,
And she don't wanna go outside tonight,
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland,
Or sells love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
Angels to fly,

I don't want bruise your ears.
Or hurt you again,
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab,
When I needed a friend?
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound!
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd.
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now.
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud.
And I can't, no, I won't hush,
I'll say the words that make you blush.
I'm gonna sing this now.
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is.
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists.
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous.
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures!
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me.
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy.
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free.
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me.
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you.
You need me, man, I don't need you.
You need me, man, I don't need you at all.
You need me, man, I don't need you.
You need me, man, I don't need you.
You need me, man, I don't need you.
You need me, man, I don't need you at all.
You need me.

It's late in the evenin', glass on the side.
I've been sat with you for most of the night.
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear.
So maybe we could get down now,
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program.
I want you to be mine, lady.
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land,
And for the longest time, lady,
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone.
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh!
If you love me, come on, get involved.
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe.
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh!
Sing,
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!
Louder,
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!
Sing,
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!

I met this girl late last year.
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear".
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake".
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait.
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned,
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn.
But I gave her my time for two or three nights,
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right.
I went away for months until our paths crossed again.
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend!
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10.
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin!
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM".
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'!
Don't **** with my love?
That heart is so cold.
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that, babe.
Don't **** with my love?
I told her, she knows.
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that, babe.

The message resonated with fans, and it….
When your legs don't work like they used to before?
And I can't sweep you off of your feet,
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy,
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three,
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how,
People fall in love in mysterious ways.
Maybe just the touch of a hand.
And I just wanna tell you I am,
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms,
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars.
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud,
Maybe we found love right where we are.
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades?
And the crowds don't remember my name,
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm?
I know you will still love me the same.
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen!
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory!

Na-na-na-na,
Mmm,
I've been spinnin' now for time.
Couple women by my side.
I got sinnin' on my mind.
Sippin' on red wine,
I've been sittin' here for ages.
Rippin' out the pages,
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now!
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes.
One or two could free my mind.
This is how it ends.
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream.
Fading out again,
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream.
So tell me when it kicks in,

When I was six years old, I broke my leg,
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends.
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down,
I was younger then, take me back to when I.
Found my heart and broke it here.
Made friends and lost them through the years.
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown,
But I can't wait to go home,
I'm on my way,
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes.
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer",
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real,
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill.
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes.
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends.
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right?
But I was younger then, take me back to when,
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid.
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight.
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown.
But I can't wait to go home,

A club isn't the best place to find a lover.
So the bar is where I go,
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots.
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow.
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me,
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now,
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox.
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like,
Girl, you know I want your love.
Your love was handmade for somebody like me!
Well, come on now, follow my lead.
I may be crazy, don't mind me.
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much".
Grab on my waist and put that body on me.
Well, come on now, follow my lead.
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm!
I'm in love with the shape of you.
We push and pull like a magnet do.
Although my heart is fallin' too.
I'm in love with your body.
And last night, you were in my room,
And now my bed sheets smell like you,
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new.
Well, I'm in love with your body.

Ooh, ooh,
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no.
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control.
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes.
And tonight had something wonderful,
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone.
Conversations with a stranger I barely know.
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't.
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do.
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space.
And I know I lose control of the things that I say,
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape!
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true!
My bad habits lead to you.
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,
My bad habits lead to you.
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,
My bad habits lеad to you.

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours.
So I could just show up and bring the news,
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her.
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you.
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine.
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day,
So much has changed since you've been away,
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours.
So I could just swing by and ask your advice,
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them.
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right?
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure.
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create".
So much has changed since you've been away,
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours.
And I would ask them if I could take you home,
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best,
So I will live life the way you taught me,
And make it on my own,

I took an arrow to the heart.
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours!
Strawberries and then somethin' more.
Ooh, yeah, I want it all.
Lipstick on my guitar,
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far.
Go dancin' underneath the stars!
Ooh, yeah, I want it all.
Mmm, you got me feelin' like.
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes.
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm.
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night.
Yeah, you got me singin' like!
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that.
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers,
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks!
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back,
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that",
And when you're close up, give me the shivers,
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks!
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back,

This is a dark parade.
Another rough patch to rain on.
To rain on,
I know your friends may say.
This is a cause for celebration.
Hip, hip, hooray, love,
Photographs in sepia tones,
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold,
Alone,
There are times when I can feel your ghost.
Just when I'm almost letting you go.
The cards were stacked against us both.
I will always love you for what it's worth!
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass!
And I know time may change the way you think of us,
But I'll remember the way we were,
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave!
Baby, you will never be lost on me!
This is a goddamn shame.
I never wanted to break it!
Leave us tainted,
Know I should walk away.
But I just can't replace us,
Or even erase us,

Build the fire and gather 'round the tree.
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me.

So kiss me under the mistletoe,
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow.
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go.
Next year, you never know!
But for now, Merry Christmas,
We'll,
dance in the kitchen,
while embers glow,
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all.
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know.
My God, you look bеautiful.
Right now, Merry Christmas,

The fire is raging on.
And we'll all sing along to the song,
Just having so much fun.
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone!

I met her smokin' a cigarette in a toilet cubicle.
Red  dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful.
This  ain't the time or place to start a future, but, darlin', I don't care.
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere!
Well, darlin', here we go again.
We  are only man and woman and we all make mistakes.
"Don't  you know we're only human?", is what I heard you say.
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain,
'Cause  I have felt the same, no.
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice!
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try.
And I see a hope that's in her eyes,
Oh,  can you see the love in mine?
She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine.
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined.
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go,
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls.
Well, darlin', here we go again.
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts!
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are.
And I could put you back together when you come apart,
And we should make a start now, oh,

It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives.
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine.
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life.
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two?
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you,
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do.
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth,
Why am I feelin' so nervous when?
Things are goin' so perfect? And.
But I know that it's worth it to,
Spend forever with you!
And so I count to three and get on one knee,
And I ask you,
Darlin', honestly,
I've waited all this time just to make it right.
So I'll ask you,
Will you marry me? Just say yes?
One word, one love, one life.
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair.
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware.
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes.
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives?
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red.
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed.
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth.
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you,

I will remember you.
In the way you'd want me to,
But it's hard to come to terms right now,
Sunset looked today,
As if it knew you'd gone away.
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down!
Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain!
Oh, I could be a shoulder, not a burden!
And it's time for me to call your son again,
And say,
She was the starlight in darkness.
She was the first bloom in spring.
An angel with a smile like electric light.
All the time, hit her wings.
She was the birdsong in morning.
But now everything here has changed!
All the world's less beautiful.
Since you've been away,
I will remember you.
With white wine by the barbecue,
On New York at the birthday do, downtown,
All that comes to mind.
When I think about the time?
Is a memory of laughin' out loud?

Welcome to the world,
I heard your heart beat and lost every word.
Just stood there quietly taking in the sound.
Of our love,
This is gonna hurt,
But I'll stand beside you, for better or for worse,
And I will find you whenever you're lost!
I'll be right here,
And ooh, I know that everything's changin'!
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing.
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same.
And this love won't ever go away,
Welcome to the world,
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt,
Don't let them change you, words are only words?
Just like I loved you.
And yes, you were the first,
A new beginning, bright and unreserved.
A beautiful red flower in the earth.
Will grow, and I know?

I know it's a bad idea.
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year.
And I thought a few drinks, they might help.
It's been a while, my dear.
Dealin' with the cards life dealt.
I'm still holdin' back these tears.
While my friends are somewhere else!
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February.
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat.
'Cause I'm here alonе,
Just dancin' with my eyes closed.
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you!
And time is movin' so slow,
And I don't know what else that I can do,
So I'll keep dancin' with my,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes,
So I'll keep dancin' with my,

Came in for the embers.
Stayed out for the breeze.
I need to feel elements to remind me.
There's beauty when it's bleak.
Stuck out long before lights down.
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know?
The more that I love, the less that I feel.
The times that I jumped never were real!
They say that all scars will heal, but I know.
Maybe I won't,
But the waves won't break my boat,
But the waves won't brеak my boat,
The stones crash on the boardwalk.
Thе wind rush through the trees.
I keep my eyes peeled.
The memories always fall short!
Of what we could've been,
Left out long before last call.
What do I need? Oh, I know?

He explained his motivation for….
I found a love for me.
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead!
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet.
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me!
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love.
Not knowin' what it was!
I will not give you up this time.
But, darlin', just kiss me slow.
Your heart is all I own.
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine,
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms!
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song.
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath?
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight",
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know.
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home.
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets.
To carry love, to carry children of our own,

The song…,
Lovin' can hurt,
Lovin' can hurt sometimes,
But it's the only thing that I know,
And when it gets hard,
You know it can get hard sometimes.
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.
We keep this love in a photograph.
We made these memories for ourselves.
Where our eyes are never closin'?
Hearts are never broken!
And time's forever frozen still!
So you can keep me,
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet.
You won't ever be alone.
Wait for me to come home.
Lovin' can heal,
Lovin' can mend your soul.
And it's the only thing that I know, know,
I swear it will get easier.
Remember that with every piece of ya.
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die.

Ed Sheeran…,
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill.
I threw the day-old tea from the cup.
Memories of a life that's been loved.
Took the get-well-soon cards and stuffed animals.
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink.
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"!
But, Mum, there's a tear every time that I blink.
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know!
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved.
So I'll sing Hallelujah,
You were an angel in the shape of my mum.
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up?
Spread your wings as you go.
When God takes you back?
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home".
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up.
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case.
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek.
And wiped a tear from the side of my face,

Walkin' down 29th and Park.
I saw you in another's arm.
Only a month we've been apart.
You look happier.
Saw you walk inside a bar.
He said somethin' to make you laugh.
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours.
Yeah, you look happier, you do!
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you!
But ain't nobody love you like I do!
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby.
If you're movin' on with someone new.
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do.
My friends told me one day I'll feel it, too.
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth,
But I know I was happier with you,
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah,
Sat in the corner of the room.
Everything's reminding me of you!
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself.
You're happier, aren't you?

I found a love for me.
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead!
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet.
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me!
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love.
Not knowin' what it was!
I will not give you up this time.
But, darling, just kiss me slow.
Your heart is all I own.
And in your eyes, you're holding mine,
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms!
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song.
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath?
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight,
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know.
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home.
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets.
To carry love, to carry children of our own,

She played the fiddle in an Irish band.
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand.
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance".
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar.
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar.
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun.
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun.
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar.
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance.
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band.
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand.
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance".
With my pretty little Galway Girl,
You're my pretty little Galway Girl.
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool.
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room!
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool.
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes,
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet!
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat.
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week!
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me,

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys.
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys.
You left a blood stain on the floor.
You set your sights on him.
You left a handprint on the door.
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before.
This is our luck, baby, running out.
Our clothes were never off!
We still have our roads to run about.
I've seen you in a fight you lost.
I've seen you in a fight.
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me.
In our house made of paper, your words all over me,
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me.
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys.
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys.

It’s about letting go. As opposed to all the….
Oh, oh, starry-eyed!
Hip, oh, sta-a-a-a—,
Oh, oh, deye-yrrats!
​swolg ydobyrevE, starry-eyed,
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning.
Handlebars that I let go, let go for anyone.
Take me in and I'll throw out my heart and get a new one.
Next thing, we're touching,
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning, ah.
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed!
And everybody glows,
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed!
And my body goes,
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah.
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah.
Woah, oh, oh,
So we burst into colours, colours and carousels,
Fall head first like paper planes and playground games.

I had a way then.
Losing it all on my own.
I had a heart then.
But the queen has been overthrown,
And I'm not sleeping now,
The dark is too hard to beat.
And I'm not keeping now,
The strength I need to push me.
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone.
You shine it when I'm alone.
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong,
And dreaming when they're gone,
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home.
Calling, calling, calling home,
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone.
You shine it when I'm alone.
Noises!
I play within my head.
Touch my own skin,
And hope that I'm still breathin',
And I think back to when,
My brother and my sister slept.
In an unlocked place,
The only time I feel safe.

It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside.
I'm not one of those who can easily hide.
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did.
I'd buy a big house where we both could live.
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do,
See, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue.
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean.
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen.
And you can tell everybody,
This is your song,
It may be quite simple, but.
Now that it's done!
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind.
That I put down in words.
How wonderful life is?
Now you're in the world!
If I was a sculptor, but, then again, no.
Or a girl who makes potions in a travelling show,
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do.
My gift is my song and this one's for you.

Stripped to the waist, we fall into the river.
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret.
I've been trying to hide.
We held our breath to see our names are written.
On the wreck of '86,
That was the year I knew the panic was over.
Yes, since we found out, since we found out!
That anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could,
After the war, we said we'd fight together,
I guess we thought that's just what humans do.
Letting darkness grow!
As if we need its palette and we need its colour.
But now I've seen it through and now I know the truth,
That anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could,

We don't have to worry 'bout nothing!
'Cause we got the fire.
And we're burning one hell of a something,
They,
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space.
Light it up,
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race.
When the lights turned down?
They don't know what they heard.
Strike the match, play it loud.
Giving love to the world.
We'll be raising our hands.
Shinin' up to the sky.
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire.
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire!
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn,
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn.
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn!
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn.

We were lovers for the first time.
Running all the red lights.
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah.
We were sipping on emotions.
Smoking and inhaling every moment.
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah.
We were high and we were sober.
We were on and we were over.
We were young and now I'm older.
But I'd do it all again,
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes.
Ten dollars was a fat stack.
I'd do it all again.
Bomber jacket and a snapback.
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach.
"Re: Stacks" on the playback.
I'd do it all again.
We were lovers on a wild ride.
Speeding for the finish line.
Come until the end of our time, yeah!
Started off as a wildfire.
Burning down the bridges to our empire.
Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah.

You're the light, you're the night.
You're the colour of my blood.
You're the cure, you're the pain.
You're the only thing I wanna touch.
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much!
You're the fear, I don't care.
'Cause I've never been so high!
Follow me through the dark.
Let me take you past the satellites!
You can see the world you brought to life, to life.
So love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do,
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do!
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do.
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out,
On the edge of paradise,
Every inch of your skin.
Is a holy grail I've gotta find?
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah.

Oh, oh, oh, oh!
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started.
I don't even really know what you intended.
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous.
Poured it down, so I poured it down.
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you.
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you.
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos.
Poured it down, so I poured it down.
And now I don't understand it,
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth.
And I know I shouldn't say it,
But my heart don't understand,
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?
But my heart don't understand,
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?

Even though we both know we're liars.
And we start each other's fires,
We just know that we'll be alright.
Even though we're kicked out the party.
'Cause we both hate everybody.
We're the ones they wanna be like.
So don't let me down,
Keep me in trouble,
Born to be wild,
Out in the jungle,

And I don't wanna be somebody without your body!
Close to me,
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody!
Close to me (,
Yeah, yeah!
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like.
Animal like you,
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body!
Close to me (,
Woo,
You can never come too close for comfort!
I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn.
I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover.
And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber,
Iced out body, didn't go to college.
Price tag poppin', then you on a private.
Don't say sorry, everyone's watchin'?
When you're where I am, everything's timeless?

Remember me in a simple way, not what I did or said.
When I think of you now, I just think of the day we met?
Don't forget me, like I didn't care?
Yeah, I stole from myself just to make you complete!
I don't think you have the patience.
I don't think you know the difference.
And I don't want cute imitations,
I know you wanted to save me.
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you,
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough.
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you,
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on.
Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know, I wanna know.
When the memories pack up and leave, it will set me free?
All those days on the beach will be washing away from me.
I will keep you secretly just to keep the peace.
Keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas.

Do you remember when we moved out?
My mum said, "I love you, but it's a small house".
So we changed up and saved up,
Gave up our town,
We were dangerous, couldn't tame us.
What's missing now?
Time (,
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
Suddenly, we got no time (.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
We're so busy doing life (.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine.
If you just focus on me.
Like we were sixteen,
And plotting our lives,
Can I wear your t-shirt and sleep?
On you while I dream,
Of all the good times?
When we were sixteen?
Like we were sixteen,
Like we were sixteen,

You can worry 'bout this.
You can worry 'bout that.
You can worry 'bout she.
You can worry 'bout this.
You can worry 'bout that.
You can worry 'bout she.
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me!
Lately, I don't think, I don't think about you, feelin' so free.
Been jumpin' through hoops to get under you, but now I'm cool.
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me!
Been havin' good times,
Been havin' late nights, yeah.
And then you call me,
Ask if I'm alright, what the hell?
Sayin' that you care about me.
But you just wanna be in my head 'cause you're lonely,
I thought I needed you to feel safe.
But now that I've been through it, I'm stuck in a good place,
Ooh, why you tryna put me in a different mood?
Just because I'm still not seein' someone new?

Painted to pure perfection,
We had a real connection.
Bodies aching, overtaken,
You kept me at a distance.
Not asking any questions!
Fingers pressing, learning lessons,
Beautiful lies on a Friday night.
Starting to wonder where we lost the magic.
Head in the clouds, talking so loud, all I hear is static.
I'm not a material girl.
Everything in your world just feels like plastic!
Wearing your crown, it's pulling me down.
You just want the power.
You're not really down for love.
You just want the power.
No, I'm not chasing paper!
And I'm not faking neither,
Take me higher or this will expire.
Your self obsessions boring,
Sorry if I'm ignoring,
Mindless actions lead to destruction.

Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me.
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me.
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me!
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me.
I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed.
I bet you're still walkin' on a tightrope.
Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho.
You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know.
It's a thin line between all this love and hate.
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place,
So, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate.
Yeah, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate!
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me,
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me.
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me!
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me.
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me.
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me.
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me!
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me.

Fire and ice,
This love is like fire and ice.
This love is like rain and blue skies.
This love is like sun on the rise.
This love got me rolling the dice.
Don't let me lose?
Still falling for you,
Still falling for you,
Beautiful mind,
Your heart got a story with mine.
Your heart got me hurting at times.
Your heart gave me new kind of highs.
Your heart got me feeling so fine.
So what to do,
Still falling for you,
Still falling for you,
It took us a while.
With every breath a new day,
With love on the line,
We've had our share of mistakes.
But all your flaws and scars are mine,
Still falling for you,
Still falling for you,

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times.
Welcome to the final show.
I hope you're wearing your best clothes.
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky.
You look pretty good down here.
But you ain't really good,
If we never learn we've been here before!
Why are we always stuck and running from?
The bullets, the bullet?
We never learn, we've been here before!
Why are we always stuck and running from?
Your bullets, a bullet?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times.
We gotta get away from here.
We gotta get away from here.
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright.
They told me that the end is near.
We gotta get away from here.
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life.
Breaking through the atmosphere,
Things look pretty good from here.
Remember everything will be alright!
We can meet again somewhere!
Somewhere far away from here!

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way.
Never coming back down!
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay.
Wouldn't put it like that?
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way.
Never coming around!
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same.
La-da-da-da-da,
All the lights couldn't put out the dark.
Runnin' through my heart,
Lights up and they know who you are.
Know who you are,
Do you know who you are?
Shine, step into the light.
Shine, so bright sometimes,
Shine, I'm not ever going back.
Shine, step into the light.
Shine, so bright sometimes,
Shine, I'm not ever going back.
Shine, step into the light.
Shine, so bright sometimes,
Shine, I'm not ever,

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'.
And it sounds just like a song,
I want more berries and that summer feelin'.
It's so wonderful and warm.
Breathe me in, breathe me out.
I don't know if I could ever go without.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I don't know if I could ever go without.
Watermelon sugar high,
Watermelon sugar high,
Watermelon sugar high,
Watermelon sugar high,
Watermelon sugar,
Strawberries on a summer evenin'.
Baby, you're the end of June!
I want your belly and that summer feelin'.
Getting washed away in you!
Breathe me in, breathe me out.
I don't know if I could ever go without.

Walk in your rainbow paradise.
Strawberry lipstick state of mind.
I get so lost inside your eyes.
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me.
You don't have to say nothing!
You don't have to say you're mine.
Honey!
I'd walk through fire for you.
Just let me adore you.
Oh, honey!
I'd walk through fire for you.
Just let me adore you.
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do.
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do.
Your wonder under summer skies.
Brown skin and lemon over ice.
Would you believe it?

Holdin' me back,
Gravity's holdin' me back,
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand.
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say!
When everything gets in the way?
Seems you cannot be replaced.
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh,
In this world, it's just us,
You know it's not the same as it was.
In this world, it's just us,
You know it's not the same as it was.
As it was, as it was.
You know it's not the same.
Answer the phone,
"Harry, you're no good alone.
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"?
Ringin' the bell,
And nobody's coming to help!
Your daddy lives by himself.
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh.

I had started to feel myself becoming someone I didn’t want to be, and that was really hard.
Harry brings his agony to life….
I'm in my bed,
And you're not here,
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands,
Forget what I said,
It's not what I meant.
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left,
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'.
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'.
You said you cared, and you missed me too.
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you,
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe,
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say,
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'.
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'.

Put a price on emotion.
I'm looking for something to buy.
You've got my devotion,
But man, I can hate you sometimes,
I don't want to fight you.
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt,
We'll get the drinks in.
So I'll get to thinking of her,
We'll be a fine line.
We'll be a fine line.
We'll be a fine line.
We'll be a fine line.
We'll be a fine line.
We'll be a fine line.
Test of my patience,
There's things that we'll never know!
You sunshine, you temptress.
My hand's at risk, I fold.
Crisp trepidation,
I'll try to shake this soon.
Spreading you open,
Is the only way of knowing you?
Ooh, ooh,

“Matilda” is the seventh track off Harry’s House, the third studio album by Harry Styles.
You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal".
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels,
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now!
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal,
You can let it go.
You can throw a party full of everyone you know!
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love!
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm.
Matilda,
, you talk of the pain like it's all alright.
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе,
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days.
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind.
You can let it go.
You can throw a party full of everyone you know!
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love!
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up.
You can see the world, following the seasons.
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason!
'Cause they never showed you love!
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own.

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes.
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect.
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it,
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck.
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it.
But I'm into it , I'm kinda into it,
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it.
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said.
"I'm having your baby",
"It's none of your business".
"I'm having your baby",
"It's none of your business".
"I'm having your baby",
"It's none of your business".
"I'm having your baby",
"It's none of your, it's none of your—".
It's New York, baby, always jacked up!
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up!
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus?
In a black dress,
she's such an actress,

Here to take my medicine, take my medicine.
Treat you like a gentleman.
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline.
Think I'm gonna stick with it.
I'm here to take my medicine, take my medicine.
Rest it on my fingertips.
And up to your mouth, I'm feelin' it out,
I'm feelin' it now,
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted.
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you t—,
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive.
You got that something, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it.
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh.
La-la-la-la-da,
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh.
La-la-la-la-da,
Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes.
Tingle running through my bones.
The boys and the girls are in.
I mess around with him.
And I'm okay with it,

Coucou,
Don't you call him "baby"?
We're not talkin' lately,
Don't you call him what you used to call me?
I, I confess,
I can tell that you are at your best.
I'm selfish so I'm hating it.
I noticed that.
There's a piece of you in how I dress.
Take it as a compliment.
Don't you call him "baby"?
We're not talkin' lately,
Don't you call him what you used to call me?
I, I just miss,
I just miss your accent and your friends.
Did you know I still talk to them?

Justin dedicated the music…,
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror.
And I can't help but notice,
You reflect in this heart of mine.
If you ever feel alone and.
The glare makes me hard to find.
Just know that I'm always!
Parallel on the other side.
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul.
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go.
Just put your hand on the glass.
I'll be tryna pull you through.
You just gotta be strong.
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now.
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me.
The vacancy that sat in my heart.
Is a space that now you hold?
Show me how to fight for now.
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy,
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out.
You were right here all along.
It's like you're my mirror.
My mirror's staring back at me.
I couldn't get any bigger.
With anyone else beside me,
And now it's clear as this promise,
That we're making,
Two reflections into one,
'Cause it's like you're my mirror.
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me.
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled.
And I can't help but stare, 'cause,
I see truth somewhere in your eyes!
Ooh, I can't ever change without you.
You reflect me, I love that about you.
And if I could, I,
Would look at us all the time?
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul.
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go.
Just put your hand on the glass.
I'm here tryna pull you through.
You just gotta be strong.

[Intro: Justin Timberlake &,
Timbaland,
Ooh-oh,
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit tied.
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit.
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby, 'cause.

Wait a minute,
You ready, JT?
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'.
Hey, going hot, so hot, just like an oven.
And ow! Burned myself, I just had to touch it,
But it's so fire, and it's all mine,
Hey, baby, and we don't mind all the watchin', ha.
'Cause if they study close, real close.
They might learn somethin'.
She ain't nothin' but a little doozy when she does it.
She's so fire tonight,
And as long as I got my suit and tie,
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight.
And you got fixed up to the nines,
Let me show you a few things!
All pressed up in black and white.
And you're dressed in that dress I like,
Love is swingin' in the air tonight!
Let me show you a few things!
Let me show you a few things!
Show you a few things about love.
Now we're in the swing of love!
Let me show you a few things!
Show you a few things about love, hey.

Mhmm, yeah, alright,
Ooh,
[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake,
Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton.
Everyone knows!
all about my direction,
And in my heart somewhere!
I wanna go there.
Still, I don't go there.
Everybody says, "Say somethin'",
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'".
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'".
Then, "Say somethin'",
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it.
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no,
Caught up in the middle of it.
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no!
Caught up in the rhythm of it.
[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake &,
Chris Stapleton,
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have.
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have.
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have.

I'm bringin' sexy back,
Yeah!
Them other boys don't know how to act,
Yeah!
I think it's special, what's behind your back?
Yeah!
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack,
Yeah!
Take it to the bridge.
c'mon,
[Bridge: Justin Timberlake &,
Timbaland,
Dirty babe,
Uh-huh,
You see these shackles, baby, I'm your slave,
Uh-huh,
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave,
Uh-huh,
It's just that no one makes me feel this way,
Uh-huh,
Take it to the chorus.
[Chorus: Timbaland &,
Justin Timberlake,
Come here, girl!
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Come to the back!
Go 'head, be gone with it!
VIP,
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Drinks on me,
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Let me see what you're twerkin' with!
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Look at those hips.
Go 'head, be gone with it!
You make me smile.
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Go 'head, child!
Go 'head, be gone with it!
And get your sexy on,
Go 'head, be gone with it!

Get your sexy on, ha!
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Get your sexy on!
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Get your sexy on!
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Get your sexy on!

I got this feelin' inside my bones.
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on.
All through my city, all through my home.
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone.
I got that sunshine in my pocket.
, got that good soul in my feet.
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops.
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally.
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop.
And under the lights when everything goes!
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close!
When we move, well, you already know?
So just imagine,
Nothin' I can see but you!
When you dance, dance, dance?
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you.
So just dance, dance, dance, come on,
All those things I shouldn't do.
But you dance, dance, dance,
And ain't nobody leavin' soon!
So keep dancin',

Gaga…,
Tell me somethin', girl,
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
I'm fallin',
In all the good times, I find myself longin',
For change,
And, in the bad times, I fear myself.
Tell me something, boy,
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?
I'm falling,
In all the good times, I find myself longing,
For change,
And, in the bad times, I fear myself.
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in.
I'll never meet the ground!
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us.
We're far from the shallow now.

I, I just woke up from a dream.
Where you and I had to say goodbye?
And I don't know what it all means,
But since I survived, I realized,
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow?
Nobody's promised tomorrow!
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night,
Like it's the last night.
If the world was ending.
I'd wanna be next to you.
If the party was over.
And our time on Earth was through,
I'd wanna hold you just for a while.
And die with a smile,
If the world was ending.
I'd wanna be next to you.

Mum-mum-mum-mah,
Mum-mum-mum-mah,
Mum-mum-mum-mah,
Mum-mum-mum-mah,
Mum-mum-mum-mah,
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please.
Fold 'em,
let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me!
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start!
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart,
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got.
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got.
Can't read my, can't read my?
No, he can't read my poker face!
Can't read my, can't read my?
No, he can't read my poker face!

Gaga talked to Grazia about writing this record saying:
I was in Russia, then Germany, and….
Oh, caught in a bad romance!
Oh, caught in a bad romance!
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah,
Roma, roma-ma,
Gaga, ooh, la, la,
Want your bad romance,
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah,
Roma, roma-ma,
Gaga, ooh, la, la,
Want your bad romance,
I want your ugly, I want your disease.
I want your everything as long as it's free!
I want your love.
Love, love, love, I want your love, ayy!
I want your drama, the touch of your hand (.
Hey,
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand.
I want your love.
Love, love, love, I want your love!
You know that I want you.
And you know that I need you,
I want it bad, your bad romance.

Gaga played a short snippet of….
Abracadabra, abracadabra,
Abracadabra, abracadabra,
Pay the toll to the angels.
Drawing circles in the clouds.
Keep your mind on the distance.
When the devil turns around?
Hold me in your heart tonight.
In the magic of the dark moonlight,
Save me from this empty fight.
In the game of life,
Like a poem said by a lady in red.
You hear the last few words of your life.
With a haunting dance,
now you're both in a trance!
It's time to cast your spell on the night.
"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na,
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga,
Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na",
In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight",

It doesn't matter if you love him.
Or capital "H-I-M",
M, M, M, M,
Just put your paws up.
'Cause you were born this way, baby.
My mama told me when I was young.
"We are all born superstars".
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on.
In the glass of her boudoir,
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"!
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe".
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far,
Listen to me when I say.
I'm beautiful in my way.
'Cause God makes no mistakes.
I was born this way.
Don't hide yourself in regret?
Just love yourself and you're set.
I was born this way.

‘Always Remember Us This Way’ is the 8th song featured on the A Star is Born Soundtrack!
That Arizona sky,
Burnin' in your eyes,
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire.
It's buried in my soul.
Like California gold,
You found the light in me that I couldn't find.
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words,
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts.
When the sun goes down?
And the band won't play,
I'll always remember us this way!
Lovers in the night!
Poets tryna write,
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try.
But all I really know,
You're where I wanna go.
The part of me that's you will never die!
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words,
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts.
When the sun goes down?
And the band won't play,
I'll always remember us this way!

The song is about a few different things–it’s about….
We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out.
Got my flash on, it's true!
Need that picture of you, it's so magical.
We'd be so fantastico,
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous.
Not sure what it means!
But this photo of us, it don't have a price,
Ready for those,
flashing lights,
'Cause you know that, baby, I.
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me.
Papa-paparazzi,
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be!
Your papa-paparazzi,
Promise I'll be kind,
But I won't stop until that boy is mine,
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me!
Papa-paparazzi,
I'll be your girl backstage at your show.
Velvet ropes and guitars,
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets!
Eyeliner and cigarettes,
Shadow is burnt,
, yellow, dance and we turn.
My lashes are dry,
Purple teardrops I cry,
, it don't have a price.
Loving you is cherry pie.
'Cause you know that, baby, I.

Considering…,
Yeah!
Turn the mic up,
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh.
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh.
I, I feel good, I walk alone.
But then I trip over myself and I fall,
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay.
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream,
So do what you want, what you want with my body,
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party?
Do what you want, what you want with my body?
Do what you want, what you want with my body?
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me.
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry.
Do what you want, what you want with my body?
What you want with my body?
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind.
But do what you want with my body,
Do what you want with my body?
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life.
But do what you want with my body,
Do what you want with my body?

I found a guy, told me I was a star.
He held the door, held my hand in the dark.
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face.
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
And there's one more boy, he's from my past,
We fell in love, but it didn't last.
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away.
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway,
All I want is love that lasts.
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy.
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day.
But shouldn't that be enough for me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,
And I miss the days when I was young and naive,
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me.
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily!

I got my driver's license last week.
Just like we always talked about!
'Cause you were so excited for me.
To finally drive up to your house,
But today, I drove through the suburbs,
Crying 'cause you weren't around.
And you're probably with that blonde girl,
Who always made me doubt!
She's so much older than me.
She's everything I'm insecure about!
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs!
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one!
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone,
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me.
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street!
And all my friends are tired,
Of hearing how much I miss you, but,
I kinda feel sorry for them.
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do!
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs!
And pictured I was driving home to you,

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily.
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks.
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself,
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped.
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl!
Well, good for you,
You look happy and healthy, not me.
If you ever cared to ask.
Good for you!
You're doin' great out there without me, baby.
God, I wish that I could do that!
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night.
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom.
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it,
But I guess good for you,
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want!
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off.
It's like we never even happened!
Baby, what the fuck is up with that?
And good for you, it's like you never even met me!
Remember when you swore to God I was the only.
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you.
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do!

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now.
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted,
Look at you, cool guy, you got it.
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes.
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise.
I loved you truly.
You gotta laugh at the stupidity.
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes.
But you make the worst one look fine,
I should've known it was strange.
You only come out at night.
I used to think I was smart.
But you made me look so naive,
The way you sold me for parts.
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh.
Bloodsucker, fame fucker,
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire.
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news,
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too.
You're so convincing,
How do you lie without flinching?
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill!
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will?
Went for me and not her.
'Cause girls your age know better.

Car rides to Malibu,
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two.
And tradin' jackets,
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you.
Watching reruns of,
Glee,
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony.
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm.
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused.
That was our place, I found it first.
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you.
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu?  Hmm?
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same.
Another actress,
I hate to think that I was just your type.
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel,
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl".
You're singin' it together,
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her!
In between the chorus and the verse,

We broke up a month ago.
Your friends are mine, you know I know.
You've moved on, found someone new.
One more girl who brings out the better in you.
And I thought my heart was detached,
From all the sunlight of our past,
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty,
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy!
But not like how you were with me,
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go.
So find someone great, but don't find no one better,
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier.
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean!
Remember when I believed,
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart,
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart.
But she's beautiful, she looks kind,
She probably gives you butterflies.

Ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah.
I played dumb, but I always knew!
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse.
I kept quiet so I could keep you.
And ain't it funny how you ran to her,
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it!
You betrayed me.
And I know that you'll never feel sorry!
For the way I hurt, yeah,
You talked to her when we were together.
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter!
It took you two weeks to go off and date her.
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor.
Now you bring her around just to shut me down!
Show her off like she's a new trophy.
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you,
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly?

I have nightmares each week 'bout that Friday in May.
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed.
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers.
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers!
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did,
But I hold onto every detail like my life depends on it,
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge.
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough,
And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream,
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine,
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long,
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong.
The arguments that I've won against you in my head.
In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed,
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone, and I make you feel so guilty!
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry,
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me,
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy.
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people,
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal!

“lacy,” the fourth track of GUTS, sees Olivia blur the line between envy and homoeroticism.
In one lens, Rodrigo embraces her inferiority complex by personifying the beauty of women she’s intimidated by in…,
Lacy, oh Lacy, skin like puff pastry.
Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell?
Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies.
Did I ever tell you that I’m not doin' well?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care.
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time.
Watching, hidden in plain sight.
And ooh, I try, I try, I try,
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere!
The sweetest torture one could bear.
Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin’ it lately.
I feel your compliments likе bullets on skin.
Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnatе,
Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care.
Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots.
You got the one thing that I want.
Ooh, I try, I try, I try.
Try to rationalize, people are people.
But it's like you're made of angel dust,

One, two, three,
Wait, is this the song with the drums?
I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring.
He argued with me about everything!
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye.
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, "Dude, nice try".
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends,
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end!
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance.
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе,
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed,
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend.
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down?
If I had to choose, I would say right now.
I wanna get him back.
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad.
Oh, I wanna get him back!
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad.
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again!
I want to get him back, back, back.

Double OT?

Threw a TV out the window of the Montage.
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn.
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in.

They said I wouldn't be nothing!
Now they always say, "Congratulations"!
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation.

People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it.
Yeah, we made it!

Everyone wanna act like they important!
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yeah!
Everyone countin' on me drop the ball, yeah!
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah!
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky.
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side.
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eye.

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael!
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you?
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload.
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos!
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael.
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you?
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload.
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though?
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy.
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy.
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy.

I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy.
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy.
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip?

And I'm like "Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”,
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked.

She said, "Can I have some to hold?".
And I can't ever tell you no,

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy,
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ayy, ayy,
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Needless to say, I keep a check.
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless!
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck.
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck.
Needless to say, I'm keeping a check.
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless!
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck.
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck.
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip.
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip.
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt.
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt.
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse.
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose.
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya.
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much.
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya,
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower.

Ooh,
I fall apart.
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah,
She told me that I'm not enough.
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah,
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault.
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred.
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain!
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah,
Ooh, I fall apart,
Down to my core?
Ooh, I fall apart,
Down to my core?
Ooh,
didn't know it before?
Surprised when you caught me off guard.
All this damn jewelry I bought.
You was my shorty, I thought.
Never caught a feelin' this hard!
Harder than the liquor I pour.
Tell me you don't want me no more.
But I can't let go, everybody told me so,
Feelin' like I sold my soul.
Devil in the form of a whore.
Devil in the form of a whore.
You said it, no, you said it.
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh!

Oh, oh, oh!
Oh,  oh, oh!
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh!
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down.
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud.
I  couldn't be there even when I tried.
You  don't believe it, we do this every time.
Seasons change and our love went cold.
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go.
Run away, but we're running in circles.
Run away, run away,
I dare you to do something.
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame.
Run away, but we're running in circles.
Run away, run away, run away.
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go!
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go.
You thought that it was special, special.
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though,
And I still hear the echoes,
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go.

You probably think that you are better now, better now.
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around.
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down!
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything?
You know I say that I am better now, better now.
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around.
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down!
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything?
Oh woah!
I did not believe that it would end, no.
Everything came second to the Benzo!
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no.
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though.
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes.
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives.
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside.
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like!
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin',
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas,
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget.
But I can't get this shit outta my head,
You probably think that you are better now, better now.
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around.
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down!
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything?
You know I say that I am better now, better now.
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around.
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down!
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything?
Oh woah!

Said she tired of little money, need a big boy.
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy.
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy!
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah.
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen,
All the housewives pullin’ up.
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy.
You was talkin' shit in the beginning.
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin'.
I know it piss you off to see me winnin'.
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ , yeah.
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me.
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army.
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely!
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow".
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me.
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me!
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely!
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow".
Everywhere I go!
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo.
750 Lambo in the Utah snow.
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah.
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck.
Pull up to the house with some big butts.
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club.
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared?
Before I dropped,
Stoney,
none of y'all really cared!
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid!
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit,
Used to have a lot, but I got more now.
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now.
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down!
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy.

We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts.
I'm standing there,
On a balcony in summer air,
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd.
And say, "Hello",
Little did I know,
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles.
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet",
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said.
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone!
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".
So I sneak out to the garden to see you,
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh.

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset.
She's going off about something that you said.
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do!
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts.
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find.
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you.
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me.
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans.
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself.
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town,
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down.
You say you're fine, I know you better than that.
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

I stay out too late.
Got nothin' in my brain!
That's what people say, mm-mm.
That's what people say, mm-mm.
I go on too many dates.
But I can't make them stay,
At least, that's what people say, mm-mm,
That's what people say, mm-mm.
But I keep cruisin',
Can't stop, won't stop movin'?
It's like I got this music in my mind.
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright".
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play.
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate,
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake!
I shake it off, I shake it off.
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break.
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake,
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake!
I shake it off, I shake it off.

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things.
Magic, madness, heaven, sin,
Saw you there and I thought.
"Oh, my God, look at that face.
You look like my next mistake.
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy!
New money, suit and tie.
I can read you like a magazine.
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly.
And I know you heard about me,
So, hey, let's be friends.
I'm dying to see how this one ends.
Grab your passport and my hand.
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend.
So it's gonna be forever!
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm.
If the high was worth the pain.
Got a long list of ex-lovers!
They'll tell you I'm insane.
'Cause you know I love the players.
And you love the game,
'Cause we're young and we're reckless.
We'll take this way too far.
It'll leave you breathless, mm.
Or with a nasty scar,
Got a long list of ex-lovers!
They'll tell you I'm insane.
But I've got a blank space, baby,
And I'll write your name,

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood.
You know it used to be mad love.
So take a look what you've done,
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey.
Now we got problems!
And I don't think we can solve them,
You made a really deep cut.
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey.
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted.
Did you have to ruin?
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted?
Did you have to hit me?
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe?
And rub it in so deep,
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me.
Oh, it's so sad to!
Think about the good times.
You and I.
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood.
You know it used to be mad love.
So take a look what you've done,
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey.
Now we got problems!
And I don't think we can solve them,
You made a really deep cut.
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey.

I don't like your little games.
Don't like your tilted stage?
The role you made me play.
Of the fool, no, I don't like you,
I don't like your perfect crime.
How you laugh when you lie?
You said the gun was mine.
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you?
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time,
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time!
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined.
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh.
Ooh, look what you made me do.
Look what you made me do.
Look what you just made me do.
Look what you just made me.
Ooh, look what you made me do.
Look what you made me do.
Look what you just made me do.
Look what you just made me do.

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser!
Midnights become my afternoons,
When my depression works the graveyard shift?
all of the people,
I've ghosted stand there in the room.
I should not be left to my own devices.
They come with prices and vices.
I end up in crisis.
I wake up screaming from dreaming.
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving.
'Cause you got tired of my scheming.
It's me, hi,
I'm the problem, it's me.
At teatime, everybody agrees,
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror!
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero!
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby.
And I'm a monster on the hill,
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city.
Pierced through the heart, but never killed!

Vintage tee, brand new phone.
High heels on cobblestones,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing?
Sequin smile, black lipstick,
Sensual politics,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing?
But I knew you,
Dancin' in your Levi's,
Drunk under a streetlight, I.
I knew you.
Hand under my sweatshirt,
Baby, kiss it better, I!
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan,
Under someone's bed,
You put me on and said I was your favorite.
A friend to all is a friend to none.
Chase two girls, lose the one.
When you are young, they assume you know nothing?

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night.
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife.
And if it was an open-shut case,
I never would've known from that look on your face!
Lost in your current like a priceless wine.
The more that you say, the less I know.
Wherever you stray, I follow?
I'm begging for you to take my hand.
Wreck my plans, that's my man.
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind.
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in.
As if you were a mythical thing.
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring.
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win,
The more that you say, the less I know.
Wherever you stray, I follow?
I'm begging for you to take my hand.
Wreck my plans, that's my man.
You know that my train could take you home.
Anywhere else is hollow!
I'm begging for you to take my hand.
Wreck my plans, that's my man.

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold.
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now,
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze!
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place.
And I can picture it after all these days,
And I know it's long gone and,
That magic's not here no more.
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all,
Oh, oh, oh!
'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there.
I remember it all too well.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed.
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.

I remember when we broke up the first time.
We hadn't seen each other in a month.
When you said you needed space?
Then you come around again and say.
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me".
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you".
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
We called it off again last night, but.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you.
We are never, ever, ever getting back together!
We are never, ever, ever getting back together!
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me.
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together!
Like, ever,
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights.
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right,
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind,
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine,

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago.
I was in your sights, you got me alone.
You found me, you found me.
You found me-e-e-e-e.
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that.
And when I fell hard, you took a step back,
Without me, without me,
Without me-e-e-e-e,
And he's long gone when he's next to me,
And I realize the blame is on me,
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
'Til you put me down, oh.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
'Til you put me down, oh.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
And the saddest fear comes creeping in,
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
'Til you put me down, oh.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
Trouble, trouble, trouble,
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
Trouble, trouble, trouble,

It feels like a perfect night.
To dress up like hipsters,
And make fun of our exes,
Uh-uh, uh-uh,
It feels like a perfect night.
For breakfast at midnight,
To fall in love with strangers,
Uh-uh, uh-uh,
Yeah!
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time.
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah.
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines.
It's time, oh-oh,
I don't know about you.
But I'm feeling twenty-two,
Everything will be alright if!
You keep me next to you.
You don't know about me.
But I'll bet you want to,
Everything will be alright if!
We just keep dancing like we're.
Twenty-two, twenty-two,

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street.
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly.
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall.
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.
Losing him was blue like I'd never known!
Missing him was dark gray, all alone.
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met!
But loving him was red,
Loving him was red,
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you.
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song.
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer.
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong!
Losing him was blue like I'd never known!
Missing him was dark gray, all alone.
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met!
But loving him was red,

Taylor explained a bit about what the….
There's somethin' 'bout the way.
The street looks when it's just rained.
There's a glow off the pavement.
You walk me to the car.
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there,
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah,
Oh, yeah!
We're driving down the road.
I wonder if you know.
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now.
But you're just so cool,
Run your hands through your hair.
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you.
And I don't know how it gets better than this,
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless.
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance,
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless,
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road.
In this one-horse town,
I wanna stay right here.
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me,
In this moment now, capture it, remember it,

I am not the kind of girl.
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion.
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marrying the wrong girl.
I sneak in and see your friends.
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room!
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry.
This is surely not what you thought it would be.
I lose myself in a daydream.
Where I stand and say?
Don't say yes, run away now?
I'll meet you when you're out.
Of the church, at the back door,
You need to hear me out.
And they said, "Speak now",
Fond gestures are exchanged,
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march,
And I am hiding in the curtains,
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be.

Oh-oh, oh-oh!
Oh-oh, oh-oh!
You were in college working part time waitin' tables.
Left a small town, never looked back!
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling.
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts!
I say, "Can you believe it?".
As we're lyin' on the couch.
The moment I could see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now!
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together.
And there's a drawer of my things at your place,
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded.
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes!

I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier than ever.
We small talk, work and the weather.
Your guard is up and I know why.
Because the last time you saw me.
Is still burned in the back of your mind?
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.
So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night".
And I go back to December all the time,
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you!
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright.
I go back to December all the time.
These days, I haven't been sleeping.
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call?
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times.
I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
And realized I loved you in the fall,

You, with your words like knives.
And swords and weapons that you use against me,
You have knocked me off my feet again.
Got me feeling like I'm nothing!
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard.
Calling me out when I'm wounded.
You, pickin' on the weaker man.
Well, you can take me down.
But you don't know what you don't know,
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean,
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean,
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides.
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation,
You have pointed out my flaws again.
As if I don't already see them.
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out.
'Cause I'll never impress you!
I just wanna feel okay again.

I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us.
How we met and the sparks flew instantly?
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones",
I used to know my place was the spot next to you.
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat!
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on.
Oh, a simple complication!
Miscommunications lead to fallout,
So many things that I wish you knew,
So many walls up, I can't break through,
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room!
And we're not speakin',
And I'm dyin' to know,
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate.
When it all broke down?
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,

He said the way my blue eyes shined.
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night.
I said, "That's a lie".
Just a boy in a Chevy truck.
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck.
On backroads at night,
And I was right there beside him all summer long,
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone,
But when you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think my favorite song.
The one we danced to all night long.
The moon like a spotlight on the lake.
When you think happiness?
I hope you think that little black dress.
Think of my head on your chest.
And my old faded blue jeans,
When you think Tim McGraw?
I hope you think of me.
September saw a month of tears.
And thankin' God that you weren't here,
To see me like that,
But in a box beneath my bed,
Is a letter that you never read?
From three summers back,

just thought it…,
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy.
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me.
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy,
That's fine, you won't mind if I say.
By the way,
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive!
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'.
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time,
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn.
There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge.
There's nothin' stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends.
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me,
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be.
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive!
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'.
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time,
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn.
And if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself,
'Cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health.

Drew looks at me,
I fake a smile so he won't see.
That I want and I'm needing.
Everything that we should be!
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about.
And she's got everything that I have to live without!
Drew talks to me,
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny.
That I can't even see.
Anyone when he's with me.
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right.
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night.
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star.
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do.
Drew walks by me,
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be.

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me.
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out.
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking?
Trying to see through the rain coming down.
Even though I'm not the only one.
Who feels the way I do.
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know.
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on.
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world!
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans!
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve,
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine.
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah,
But that's okay,
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know.
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on.
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world!

You have a way of coming easily to me.
And when you take, you take the very best of me,
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something,
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted,
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending!
Given to a perfect day.
Just walk away, ain't no use defending.
Words that you will never say!
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you!
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray.
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away,
And you come away with a great little story,
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you,
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending!
Given to a perfect day.
So just walk away, ain't no use defending,
Words that you will never say!
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you!

It’s about what I was going through….
I didn't know what I would find.
When I went looking for a reason, I know?
I didn't read between the lines.
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go!
I tried to take the road less traveled by.
But nothing seems to work the first few times!
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in!
I can still see you, this ain't the best view.
On the outside looking in,
I've been a lot of lonely places.
I've never been on the outside!
You saw me there, but never knew!
That I would give it all up to be.
A part of this, a part of you.
And now, it's all too late, so you see,
You could've helped if you had wanted to.
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything,

I wrote  about one of….
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty.
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you?
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty.
But that's not true,
'Cause I know you,
Hold on, baby, you're losing it.
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go.
And no one knows,
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone.
That you might not be the golden one.
And you're tied together with a smile,
But you're coming undone, oh,
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted.
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change.
Hoping it will end up in his pocket.
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain,
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay!
It's not his price to pay.
Hold on, baby, you're losing it.
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go.
And no one knows,
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone.
That you might not be the golden one.
And you're tied together with a smile,
But you're coming undone, oh,
Oh, oh!

Cory's eyes are like a jungle.
He smiles, it's like the radio.
He whispers songs into my window.
In words that nobody knows!
There's pretty girls on every corner.
They watch him as he's walking home.
Saying, "Does he know?",
Will you ever know?
You're beautiful, every little piece, love.
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone,
And when you find everything you looked for!
I hope your life leads you back to my door.
Oh, but if it don't!
Stay beautiful,
Cory finds another way to be.
The highlight of my day.
I'm taking pictures in my mind.
So I can save 'em for a rainy day,
It's hard to make a conversation.
When he's taking my breath away?
I should say, "Hey, by the way".

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing.
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone!
Yesterday, I found out about you!
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong.
You say that you'd take it all back.
Given one chance,
It was a moment of weakness.
And you said yes,
You should've said no, you should've gone home.
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go.
You should've known that word.
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me.
And I should've been there in the back of your mind,
I shouldn't be asking myself why.
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet.
You should've said no.
Baby, and you might still have me!
You can see that I've been cryin'.
And baby, you know all the right things to say,
But do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?

She said I was seven and you were nine.
I looked at you like the stars that shined.
In the sky, the pretty lights,
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us,
Growing up and falling in love.
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes,
And said,
"Oh, my, my, my",
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree.
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me.
You never did, you never did!
Take me back when our world was one block wide.
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried.
Just two kids, you and I.
Oh, my, my, my, my!
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly.
I wasn't that little girl you used to see.
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights,
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us,
They never believed we'd really fall in love!
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes,
And said, "Oh, my, my, my",

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone.
In the front seat of his car,
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel.
The other on my heart.
I look around, turn the radio down.
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?".
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song".
And he says,
Our song is a slammin' screen door.
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window.
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow?
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know.
Our song is the way you laugh.
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have".
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen",
Askin' God if he could play it again.
I was walking up the front porch steps.
After everythin' that day,
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on?
And lost and thrown away,
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed!
I almost didn't notice all the roses.
And the note that said,

Friday night beneath the stars.
In a field behind your yard,
You and I are painting pictures in the sky.
And sometimes, we don't say a thing,
Just listen to the crickets sing.
Everything I need is right here by my side!
And I know everything about you!
I don't wanna live without you.
I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground?
It's like no matter what I do.
Well, you drive me crazy half the time.
The other half, I'm only tryin' to.
Let you know that what I feel is true!
And I'm only me when I'm with you,
Just a small-town boy and girl.
Livin' in a crazy world.
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true.
And I don't try to hide my tears,
My secrets or my deepest fears.
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do!

She can't see the way your eyes.
Light up when you smile.
She'll never notice how you stop and stare!
Whenever she walks by?
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her,
But you are everything to me!
And I just wanna show you,
She don't even know you.
She's never gonna love you like I want to!
And you just see right through me,
But if you only knew me,
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable.
Instead of just invisible,
Oh, yeah, oh!
There's a fire inside of you.
That can't help but shine through.
She's never gonna see the light!
No matter what you do!

It appears as the….
Why would you wanna break?
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take?
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make?
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break?
A perfectly good heart?
Maybe I should've seen the signs.
Should've read the writing on the wall?
And realized by the distance in your eyes,
That I would be the one to fall.
No matter what you say!
I still can't believe that you would walk away.
It don't make sense to me, but.
Why would you wanna break?
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take?
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make?
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break?
A perfectly good heart?

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors.
It's the mornin' of your very first day.
You say "hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while.
Try and stay out of everybody's way.
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here.
For the next four years in this town,
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say.
"You know, I haven't seen you around before".
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you!
You're gonna believe them,
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out,
Well, count to ten, take it in.
This is life before you know who you're gonna be.
Fifteen,
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail.
And soon enough, you're best friends,
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool.
We'll be outta here as soon as we can.
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car,
And you're feelin' like flyin',
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one,
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends,
When the night ends?

Mmm-mm, mm-mm,
Mmm-mm, mm-mm,
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah,
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving.
But I know I saw a light in you,
And as we walked, we were talking,
I didn't say half the things I wanted to.
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window,
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing.
I don't always have to be alone!
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel.
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so?
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you!
Can't help it if there's no one else?
Mmm, I can't help myself.
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling.
So I got some things to say to you, ha,
I've seen it all, so I thought.
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do!
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name.
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same.

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel.
Comes out just when you need it to!
As I paced back and forth all this time.
'Cause I honestly believed in you.
Holdin' on, the days drag on.
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known.
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale.
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell.
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town.
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down.
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse!
To come around,
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes.
And never really had a chance!
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love.
You had to fight to have the upper hand.
I had so many dreams about you and me.
Happy endings, now, I know.
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale.
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell.
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town.
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down.
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse!
To come around,

I see your face in my mind as I drive away.
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds.
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time,

Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie.
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see.
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down.
Now, I don't know what to be without you around!

And we know it's never simple, never easy!
Never a clean break,
no one here to save me!
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.

And I can't,
breathe,
without you, but I have to,
Breathe without you, but I have to.

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt!
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve.
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out!

I walked into Liz’s house, and I….
I took a chance, I took a shot.
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not,
You took a swing, I took it hard.
And down here from the ground, I see who you are,
I'm sick and tired of your attitude.
I'm feeling like I don't know you.
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down.
And I need you like a heartbeat,
But you know you got a mean streak,
That makes me run for cover when you're around.
And here's to you and your temper,
Yes, I remember what you said last night!
And I know that you see what you're doing to me,
Tell me why,
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day.
Well, I get so confused and frustrated.
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh.
I'm sick and tired of your reasons.
I got no one to believe in.
You tell me that you want me, then push me around.
And I need you like a heartbeat,
But you know you got a mean streak,
That makes me run for cover when you're around.
Here's to you and your temper.
Yes, I remember what you said last night!
And I know that you see what you're doing to me,
Tell me why,

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around.
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down.
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out,
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around,
You don't have to call anymore.
I won't pick up the phone.
This is the last straw.
Don't wanna hurt anymore?
And you can tell me that you're sorry,
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before,
You're not sorry,
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know.
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold?
And you've got your share of secrets,
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh,
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before,
But you don't have to call anymore,
I won't pick up the phone.
This is the last straw.
Don't wanna hurt anymore?
And you can tell me that you're sorry,
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before,
You're not sorry,
You're not sorry,

He is sensible and so incredible.
He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better!
He opens up my door and I get into his car.
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight",
And I feel perfectly fine,
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain,
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name,
You're so in love that you act insane.
And that's the way I loved you,
Breaking down and coming undone.
It's a roller coaster kind of rush.
And I never knew I could feel that much!
And that's the way I loved you,
He respects my space.
And never makes me wait!
And he calls exactly when he says he will,
He's close to my mother.
Talks business with my father.
He's charming and,
endearing,
And I'm comfortable,

Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye.
And we caught onto something,
I hold onto the night.
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me.
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me.
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak!
I don't feel welcome anymore.
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me!
'Cause one second, it was perfect.
Now, you're halfway out the door!
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called,
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all!
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"!
Oh, and it!
rains in your bedroom,
Everything is wrong!
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone.
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"!
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes.
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure.
So here's to everything coming down to nothing!
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core.
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore.


I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on.
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run.
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides.
Look now, the sky is gold.
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home.
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall.
But I know you're not scared of anything at all,
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away?
But I know I had the best day with you today,
I'm thirteen now,
And don't know how my friends could be so mean,
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys.
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away,
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names,
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school.
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you,
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay?
But I know I had the best day with you today,

And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you,
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and!
You know it's all the same, another time and place.
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it.
But I believe in whatever you do,
And I'll do anything to see it through,
Because these things will change.
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down.
This revolution, the time will come.
For us to finally win,
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah,
Oh, oh!
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered,
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair.
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found!
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared!
You can walk away, say we don't need this.
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this,
'Cause these things will change.
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down.
This revolution, the time will come.
For us to finally win,
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah,
Oh, oh!

I like the way you sound in the morning.
We're on the phone and without a warning.
I realize your laugh is the best sound.
I have ever heard.
I like the way I can't keep my focus.
I watch you talk, you didn't notice.
I hear the words but all I can think is.
"We should be together",
Every time you smile, I smile.
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you,
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby.
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall?
Jump, then fall into me.
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you!
Say that you wanna be with me too.
'Cause I'ma stay through it all.
So, jump, then fall,
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face.
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh.
I've never been so wrapped up, honey!
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted!
I had time to think it oh-over.
And all I can say is, "Come closer",
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me.

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky.
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why.
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you.
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun.
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone,
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream,
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name.
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven!
It's half full and I won't wait here all day.
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway.
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun,
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone,
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream,
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name.
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, oh!
In the middle of the night waking from this dream,
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me.
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven!

Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye.
We caught onto something.
I hold onto the night.
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me.
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me.
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak!
I don't feel welcome anymore.
Baby, what happened? Please tell me!
'Cause one second it was perfect.
Now you're halfway out the door!
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called,
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all!
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"!
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong!
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone.
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"!
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy.
I looked into your eyes.
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure.
So here's to everything coming down to nothing!
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core.
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore.

I could go back to every laugh.
But I don't wanna go there anymore,
And I know all the steps up to your door,
But I don't wanna go there anymore,
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky.
Talk to the man with the reasons why.
And let me know what you find,
I'll leave my window open.
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name.
Just know I'm right here hoping.
That you'll come in with the rain.
I could stand up and sing you a song.
But I don't wanna have to go that far,
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart,
And you don't even know where I start,
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears.
Talk to the man who put you here.
And don't wait for the sky to clear,

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like.
There ain’t nothing more right babe!
Misty morning comes again and I can't.
Help but wish I could see your face.
And I knew from the first note played,
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you.
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row.
Scream your name,
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like,
"I can't take my eyes off of you".
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl.
Who's desperately in love with you.
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar.
Morning loneliness,
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you!
When my world wakes up today?
You'll be in another town.
And I knew when I saw your face,
I'd be counting down the ways to see you.
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name.

In the heat of the fight, I walked away,
Ignoring words that you were saying.
Tryin' to make me stay.
And you've called a hundred times,
But I'm not picking up,
'Cause I'm so mad,
I might tell you that it's over.
But if you look a little closer,
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you.
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles,
Screaming, "I'm in love with you".
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more.
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on,
The other side of the door.
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone.
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone!
I keep going back over things we both said.
And I remember the slamming door,
And all the things that I misread,

Today was a fairytale, you were the prince.
I used to be a damsel in distress.
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six.
Today was a fairytale,
Today was a fairytale,
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress.
You wore a dark gray t-shirt.
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess.
Today was a fairytale,
Time slows down,
Whenever you're around?
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me.
Fell in love when I saw you standing there.
It must have been the way.
Today was a fairytale,
It must have been the way.
Today was a fairytale,

Mr. "Perfect face," Mr. "Here to stay".
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"!
Everything was right, Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life"!
But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart",
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart.
It takes everything in me just to get up each day!
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay,
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"!
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby!
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"!
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"!
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye.
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine",
Mr. "Never told me why,"!
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"!
Mr. "Insincere apology, so he doesn't look like the bad guy".
He goes about his day, forgets he ever even heard my name.
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same.

We used to walk along the streets.
When the porch lights were shinin' bright?
Before I had somewhere to be!
Back when we had all night.
And we were happy,
I do recall a good while back.
We snuck into the circus.
You threw your arms around my neck.
Back when I deserved it.
And we were happy,
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby?
We showed 'em all up.
No one could touch the way we!
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm.
We were gonna buy someday.
And we were happy,
We used to watch the Sun go down.
On the boats in the water,
That's sorta how I feel right now.
And goodbye's so much harder,
'Cause we were happy,

Elevator buttons and morning air.
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs.
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares.
But right now, my time is theirs,
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves!
They'll judge it like they know about me and you.
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do!
The jury's out, but my choice is you.
So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine.
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high, the water's rough.
But this love is ours,
You never know what people have up their sleeves!
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me.
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles.
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine,
And you'll say,
Don't you worry your pretty little mind?
People throw rocks at things that shine.
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high, the water's rough.
But this love is ours,

All I knew this morning when I woke.
Is I know something now?
Know something now I didn't before.
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago,
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile?
In the back of my mind, making me feel like,
I just wanna know you better.
Know you better, know you better now.
I just wanna know you better.
Know you better, know you better now.
I just wanna know you better.
Know you better, know you better now.
I just wanna know you, know you, know you.
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello".
And your eyes look like coming home,
All I know is a simple name.
And everything has changed!
All I know is you held the door.
You'll be mine and I'll be yours.
All I know since yesterday.
Is everything has changed?

Midnight,
You come and pick me up, no headlights.
Long drive,
Could end in burning flames or paradise?
Fade into view, oh,
It's been a while since I have even heard from you.
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I,
Know exactly where it leads, but I.
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time.
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye.
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like,
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time,
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style!
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt.
And I got that good-girl faith and a tight little skirt,
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time,
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style!
So it goes,
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm.
Takes me home,
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh.
That you've been out and about with some other girl".
Some other girl,

Looking at it now,
It all seems so simple.
We were lying on your couch.
I remember.
You took a Polaroid of us.
Then discovered,
The rest of the world was black and white.
But we were in screaming color,
And I remember thinking,
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good?
Looking at it now,
Last December,
We were built to fall apart.
Then fall back together,
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck.
The night we couldn't quite forget.
When we decided, we decided?
To move the furniture so we could dance,
Baby, like we stood a chance!
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying.
And I remember thinking,

He said, "Let's get out of this town.
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds".
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now".
Nothing lasts forever!
But this is gonna take me down,
He's so tall and handsome as hell.
He's so bad, but he does it so well.
I can see the end as it begins.
My one condition is,
Say you'll remember me,
Standin' in a nice dress.
Starin' at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks.
Say you'll see me again.
Even if it's just in your.
Wildest dreams, ah, ha,
Wildest dreams, ah, ha,
I said, "No one has to know what we do".
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room.
And his voice is a familiar sound,
Nothin' lasts forever!
But this is gettin' good now,

Been sittin' eyes wide open.
Behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call.
It's just a cruel existence.
Like it's no point hopin' at all.
Baby, baby, I feel crazy!
Up all night, all night and every day.
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'.
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever!
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain.
And I don't wanna fit wherever,
I just wanna keep calling your name.
Until you come back home.
I just wanna keep calling your name.
Until you come back home.
I just wanna keep calling your name.
Until you come back home.
I'm sittin' eyes wide open.
And I got one thing stuck in my mind,
Wonderin' if I dodged a bullet.
Or just lost the love of my life, oh,

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him.
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted.
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom,
Holdin' him for ransom, some.
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though.
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so.
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever!
Like a vendetta-ta,
I, I, I see how this is gon' go.
Touch me and you'll never be alone!
I-Island breeze and lights down low.
No one has to know!
In the middle of the night, in my dreams,
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm.
In the middle of the night, in my dreams,
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time.
Are you ready for it?
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me.
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry!
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and,
We'll move to an island and.
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure.
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now.
Never be the same now, now!


I wanna be your end game.
I wanna be your first string.
I wanna be your A-Team (.
Woah, woah,
I wanna be your end game, end game.

Future,
Big reputation, big reputation,
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah.
And you heard about me, ooh,
I got some big enemies.
Yeah!
Big reputation, big reputation,
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah.
Git, git,
And I heard about you, ooh,
Yeah!
You like the bad ones too.
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast.
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat.
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me.
I'm one call away whenever you need me!
I'm in a G5 , come to the A-Side.
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like.
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type.
You hold me down and I protect you with my life.

This ain't for the best.
My reputation's never been worse, so!
You must like me for me.
We can't make.
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink,
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black.
Come here, you can meet me in the back!
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you.
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue!
Just think of the fun things we could do.
This ain't for the best.
My reputation's never been worse, so!
You must like me for me.
We can't make.
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink,
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate.
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate.

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January.
And this is our place, we make the rules,
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear,
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah!
Take me out and take me home.
You're my, my, my, my lover.
We could let our friends crash in the living room.
This is our place, we make the call.
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you!
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all.
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah!
Take me out and take me home.
You're my, my, my, my lover.

I would be complex, I would be cool.
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to.
And that would be okay for me to do,
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you.
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type.
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can.
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man.
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again,
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man.
I'd be the man,
I’d be the man,
They’d say I hustled, put in the work.
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve.
What I was wearing, if I was rude?
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves?
And they would toast to me, oh , let the players play,
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez.

You are somebody that I don't know!
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón,
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM,
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out.
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out,
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?",
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression,
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun!
And snakes and stones never broke my bones!
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
You need to calm down, you're being too loud.
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down.
You are somebody that we don't know!
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile,
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?
Sunshine on the street at the parade.
But you would rather be in the dark ages,
Makin' that sign must've taken all night.

I promise that you'll never find another like me!
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh.
I know I never think before I jump!
And you're the kinda guy the ladies want,
I know that I went psycho on the phone.
I never leave well enough alone!
And trouble's gonna follow where I go,
But one of these things is not like the others,
Like a rainbow with all of the colors.
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover!
I promise that you'll never find another like!
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
I'm the only one of me.
Baby, that's the fun of me!
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
You're the only one of you.
Baby, that's the fun of you!
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night.
You know that I caught it (.
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it!
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price.
You know that I bought it (.
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it!
Killing me slow, out the window.
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below!
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes.
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more?
And it's new, the shape of your body,
It's blue, the feeling I've got.
And it's ooh, woah-oh,
It's a cruel summer,
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em.
No rules in breakable heaven!
But ooh, woah-oh,
It's a cruel summer with you.
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine.
I'm not dying (,
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it!
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times.
We're not trying (,
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it!

It keeps me awake, the look on your face.
The moment you heard the news.
You're screaming inside and frozen in time.
You did all that you could do.
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked.
The wrong ones think they’re right.
You were outnumbered this time.
But only the young, only the young,
Only the young, only the young.
Can run?
Can run?
So run, and run, and run,
So every day now,
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV.
You go to class, scared.
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be.
And the big bad man and his big bad clan,
Their hands are stained with red.
Oh, how quickly they forget!
They aren't gonna help us.
Too busy helping themselves,
They aren't gonna change this.
We gotta do it ourselves.
They think that it's over.
But it's just begun,

We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts.
I'm standing there,
On a balcony in summer air,
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd.
And say, "Hello",
Little did I know,
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles.
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet",
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said.
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone!
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".
So I sneak out to the garden to see you,
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh.

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine.
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine.
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree,
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh,
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles.
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love!
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life!
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of,
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton,
Taylor Swift,
But now that we're done and it's over,
I bet you couldn't believe.
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave?
And I bet you think about me,
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community.
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills.
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion.
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills.
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for,
And you and I fell like an early spring snow,
But reality crept in, you said we're too different,
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes.

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold.
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now,
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze!
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate.
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place.
And I can picture it after all these days,
And I know it's long gone and,
That magic's not here no more.
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all,
Oh, oh, oh!
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there.
I remember it all too well.
your cheeks were turnin' red.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed.
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the,
tee-ball team,
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me.
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy",
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town!
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now,
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was!
'Til we were dead and gone and buried.
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same.
After three months in the grave,
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you,
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame,

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind!
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind?
In the shoes I gave you as a present,
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five.
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight,
Best believe I'm still bejeweled.
When I walk in the room?
I can still make the whole place shimmer.
And when I meet the band,
They ask, "Do you have a man?".
I could still say,
"I don't remember",
Familiarity breeds contempt,
Don't put mе in the basement?
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart.
Diamonds in my eyes,
I polish up real, I polish up real nice.
Nice,
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl!
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve?
I think it's time to teach some lessons.
I made you my world , have you heard?
I can reclaim the land.
And I miss you , but I miss sparklin',

Inspired by a line from….
Meet me at midnight,
Staring at the ceiling with you.
Oh, you don't ever say too much!
And you don't really read into,
My melancholia,
I been under scrutiny.
You handle it beautifully.
All this shit is new to me.
I feel.
The lavender haze creeping up on me.
Surreal,
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say.
No deal!
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze.
All they keep asking me.
Is if I'm gonna be your bride?
The only kinda girl they see.
Is a one-night or a wife?

I-I-I-I,
You brush past me in the hallway.
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I’ve been watchin' you for ages.
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it,
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me.
And I could see you up against the wall with me,
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew,
That I can see you.
I-I-I-I,
And we kept everything professional!
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like,
They keep watchful eyes on us.
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet,
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head.
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet.

Hi!…,
He said, "Let's get out of this town.
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds".
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now".
Nothing lasts forever!
But this is gonna take me down,
He's so tall and handsome as hell.
He's so bad, but he does it so well.
I can see the end as it begins.
My one condition is,
Say you'll remember me,
Standin' in a nice dress.
Starin' at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks.
Say you'll see me again.
Even if it's just in your.
Wildest dreams, ah, ha,
Wildest dreams, ah, ha,
I said, "No one has to know what wе do".
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room.
And his voicе is a familiar sound,
Nothin' lasts forever!
But this is gettin' good now,

I was supposed to be sent away.
But they forgot to come and get me,
I was a functioning alcoholic.
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic!
All of this to say I hope you're okay.
But you're the reason,
And no one here's to blame,
But what about your quiet treason?
And for a fortnight there, we were forever!
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather.
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors!
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her.
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift,
Post Malone,
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an.
endless February,
I took the miracle move-on drug, the.
effects were temporary,
And I love you, it's ruining my life,
I love you, it's ruining my life.
I touched you for only a fortnight.
I touched you.
, but I touched you.
[Chorus: Taylor Swift,
And for a fortnight there,
we were forever!
Run into you sometimes, ask.
about the weather,
Now you're in my backyard, turned!
into good neighbors,
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her.
And for a fortnight there,
we were together.
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater.
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors!
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him.

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold.
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now,
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze!
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place.
And I can picture it after all these days,
And I know it's long gone and,
That magic's not here no more.
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all,
Oh, oh, oh!
'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there.
I remember it all too well.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed.
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy",
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town!
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now,
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was!
'Til we were dead and gone and buried.
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same.
After three months in the grave,
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you,
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame,

So  long , London,
So  long , London,
So  long , London,
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist.
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift.
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away.
My spine split from carrying us up the hill.
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill.
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe.
Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had.
Did you think I had in me?"?
Oh, the tragedy!
So long, London,
You'll find someone,
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out.
I founded the club she's heard great things about.
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath.
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use.
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to!
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free,

You left your typewriter at my apartment.
Straight from,
the tortured poets department,
I think some things I never say!
Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?".
But you're in self-sabotage mode,
Throwing spikes down on the road.
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show,
Who else decodes you?
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said.
"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith.
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots".
And who's gonna hold you like me?
Nobody!
No-fucking-body!
Nobody!
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate.
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.
I scratch your head, you fall asleep.
Like a tattooed golden retriever.
But you awaken with dread,
Pounding nails in your head.
But I've read this one where you come undone,
I chose this cyclone with you.

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames.
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away.
Stitching, "We were just kids, babe".
I said, "I don't mind, it takes time".
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed.
I felt aglow like this.
Never before and never since!
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary.
You and I go from one kiss to getting married.
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery.
Never quite buried!
In your suit and tie,
in the nick of time,
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy.
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life.
You said I'm the love of your life.
About a million times,
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate.
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes?
Well, you took me to hell too.
And all at once, the ink bleeds,
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme.
But I've felt a hole like this,
Never before and ever since!

I can see you standing, honey.
With his arms around your body,
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all.
And it took you five whole minutes,
To pack us up and leave me with it,
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall.
I think I've seen this film before.
And I didn't like the ending,
You're not my homeland anymore.
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out.
I think I've seen this film before.
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
I can see you starin', honey.
Like he's just your understudy.
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me.
Second, third, and hundredth chances.
Balancin' on breaking branches,
Those eyes add insult to injury.

I forget how the West was won.
I forget if this was ever fun.
I just learned these people only raise you.
To cage you,
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best.
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess".
I just learned these people try and save you.
'Cause they hate you,
Too high a horse,
For a simple girl,
To rise above it,
They slammed the door.
On my whole world,
The one thing I wanted.
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned!
Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him".
I'm havin' his baby,
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces!
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences.
No, I'm not coming to my senses!
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want.

Seneler sürer her günüm,
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah.
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum,
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah.
Seneler sürer her günüm,
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah.
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum,
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah.
I usually love sleeping all alone.
This time around, bring your friend with you.
But we ain't really gonna sleep at all,
You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures.
In my city, I'm a young god,
That pussy kill be so vicious.
My god white, he in my pocket.
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous.
She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often".
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often".
Bitches down to do it either way, often!
Baby, I can make that pussy rain, often!
Often, often, girl, I do this often.
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it.
Often, often, girl, I do this often.
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it.
Often,

The Weeknd…,
I've been mixin', I've been sippin'.
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl.
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'.
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water.
I want you, now now.
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now.
Don't take my number, don't want your number?
I'll call you back if that head right baby.
I won't love you, I can't love you.
Unless that pussy got some super powers.
I want you, now now.
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now.
And I woke up in the kitchen saying,
"How the hell did this shit happen?".
Oh baby, drunk in love!
We be all night.
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club.
Drunk in love,
We be all night, love, baby, love.
We be all night, love, baby, love.

I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast.
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas.
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace.
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous!
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates.
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph.
Mix it in a potion like a science.
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet.
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin'.
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher!
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas.
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private.
My flight too private,
, my shows so riot.
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall.
Then it's time for me to fly her.
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet.
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it,
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it.
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it.
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it.
Baby girl, you know what I like!
Baby, you know just what I like!
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like!

I'ma care for you,
I'ma care for you, you, you, you.
You make it look like it's magic.
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you!
I'm never confused!
Hey, hey,
And I'm so used to bein' used,
So I love when you call unexpected,
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected.
So I'ma care for you, you, you,
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah.
'Cause girl, you're perfect,
You're always worth it!
And you deserve it,
The way you work it.
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah.
Girl, you earned it, yeah.
You know our love would be tragic.
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind,
We live with no lies.
Hey, hey,
You're my favorite kind of night.

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Your man on the road, he doin' promo.
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low".
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone.
'Cause you look even better than the photos.
I can't find your house, send me the info.
Drivin' through the gated residential.
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home.
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know.
I only call you when it's half-past five.
The only time that I'll be by your side.
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me.
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me?
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah?
I only call you when it's half-past five.
The only time I'd ever call you mine.
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me.
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me?
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe?

And I know she'll be the death of me,
At least we'll both be numb,
And she'll always get the best of me!
The worst is yet to come.
But at least we'll both be beautiful,
And stay forever young!
This I know, uh,
This I know,
She told me, "Don't worry.
About it",
She told me, "Don't worry.
No more"!
We both know we can't go.
Without it,
She told me, "You'll never!
Be alo-oh-oh-ooh",
I can't feel my face when I'm with you.
But I love it,
But I love it, oh,
I can't feel my face when I'm with you.
But I love it,
But I love it, oh,

Ayy,
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah.
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah.
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah.
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah.
None of these toys on lease too, ah!
Made your whole year in a week too, yah.
Main bitch outta your league too, ah.
Side bitch outta your league too, ah.
House so empty, need a centerpiece.
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony.
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces.
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah.
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid.
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade.
Switch up my style, I take any lane.
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain.
Look what you've done,
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy,
Look what you've done,
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy,

We found each other.
I helped you out of a broken place.
You gave me comfort.
But falling for you was my mistake,
I put you on top, I put you on top.
I claimed you so proud and openly.
And when times were rough, when times were rough,
I made sure I held you close to me.
So call out my name,
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently.
I want you to stay.
I want you to stay even though you don't want me.
Girl, why can't you wait?
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name?
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and.
I'll be on my—,
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied!
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life.
Guess I was just another pit stop.
'Til you made up your mind.
You just wasted my time.

Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro.
Ayy,
Young Metro, young Metro,
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need!
Tryna find the one that can fix me.
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed.
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly.
Yeah, I want it all now!
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound.
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound.
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down!
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless?
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless,
All this money and this pain got me heartless.
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless.
Said I'm heartless,
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless.
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless!
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless.
Said I'm heartless,
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket,
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit.
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit.
Yeah, I got her watchin'!
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet.
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket.
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target!
Photoshoots, I'm a star now.
I'm talkin',
Time,
Rolling Stone,
and,
Bazaar,
now!
Bazaar,
now!
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down.
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now.

Yeah!
I've been tryna call,
I've been on my own for long enough.
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe.
I'm goin' through withdrawals,
You don't even have to do too much.
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby.
I look around and.
Sin City's cold and empty.
No one's around to judge me!
I can't see clearly when you're gone.
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights.
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch!
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night.
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust!
Hey, hey, hey,
I'm running out of time.
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky.
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh,

Thought I almost died in my dream again.
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again.
I'm fallin' in too deep.
Without you, I can't sleep,
'Cause my heart belongs to you.
I'll risk it all for you.
I want you next to me.
This time, I'll never leave!
I wanna share babies.
Protection, we won't need,
Your body next to me.
Is just a memory?
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh.
Without you, I can't sleep,
Insomnia relieve, oh,
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe.
My darkest hours,
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room.
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you.
I turned into the man I used to be, to be.
Put myself to sleep,
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams.
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me?
I just wanted to call you and say, and say.

Ooh, yeah,
I just pretend that I'm in the dark and.
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss.
I'd rather be so oblivious.
I'd rather be with you.
When it's said, when it's done, yeah?
I don't ever wanna know.
I can tell what you done, yeah.
When I look at you?
In your eyes,
I see there's something burning inside you.
Oh, inside you!
In your eyes,
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to.
Oh, you try to!
You always try to hide the pain!
You always know just what to say!
I always look the other way!
I'm blind, I'm blind,
In your eyes,
You lie, but I don't let it define you.
Oh, define you!

Ooh,
Na-na, yeah,
I saw you dancing in a crowded room.
You look so happy when I'm not with you.
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise,
I don't know why I run away.
I make you cry when I run away.
You could've asked me why I broke your heart.
You could've told me that you fell apart.
But you walked past me like I wasn't there,
And just pretended like you didn't care,
I don't know why I run away.
I make you cry when I run away.
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay.
Save your tears for another.

Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I saw the fire in your eyes.
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes.
You tell me things you wanna try.
I know temptation is the devil in disguise.
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah.
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice.
You said you do this all the time.
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light.
It's like a dream what she feels with me.
She loves to be on the edge.
Her fantasy is okay with me.
Then suddenly, baby says,
Take my breath away,
And make it last forever, babe!
Do it now or never, babe?
Take my breath away,
Nobody does it better, babe!
Bring me close to—,

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through.
I just can't say I don't love you.
'Cause I love you, yeah.
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold.
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know,
Let me tell the truth!
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah!
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes.
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry.
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night.
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time.
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love.
I try to find a reason to pull us apart.
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfеct.
And I know that you're worth it,
I can't walk away, oh.

Even though we'rе goin' through it.
And it makes you feel alone,
Just know that I would die for you.
Ooh, ooh,
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah!
The distance and the time between us.
Distance and the time,
It'll never change my mind 'cause!
Baby, I would die for you!
I would die for you.
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah!

Lock me up and throw away the key.
He knows how to get the best out of me.
I'm no force for the world to see.
Trade my whole life just to be.
Tell nobody I control you!
I broke you just to own you.
They can't tell but I love you.
'Cause you're loyal, baby,
I love when you're submissive.
You love it when I break skin.
You feel pain without flinchin'.
So say it,
Give me tough love,
Leave me with nothin' when I come down.
My kind of love,
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out.
We don't gotta bе in love, no.
I don't gotta be the onе, no.
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight.
We don't gotta be in love, no.
I don't gotta be the one, no.
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh.

I've seen the devil,
Down Sunset?
In every place,
In every face,
Yeah!
Yeah!
Tell me, do you see her?  She's livin' her life.
Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight.
But if you knew her , she lives a lie,
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised.
Oh, I know what she needs!
She just want the fame, I know what shе fiends.
Give hеr a little taste, runnin' back to me.
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh.
Ooh, every night , she prays to the sky.
Flashin' lights is all she ever wants to see.
Beggin' on her knees to be popular.
That's her dream, to be popular.
Kill anyone to be popular.
Sell her soul to be popular.
Just to be popular,
Everybody scream 'cause she popular.
She mainstream 'cause she popular.
Never be free 'cause she popular!

Sun is shining, it's over.
It's tomorrow,
Bathe yourself in the light, in your love.
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, no.
[Verse 1: Playboi Carti &.
The Weeknd,
Ever since I was a jit, knew I was the shit.
Ooh, yeah,
Shawty keep wanna come 'round, she wanna get hit.
Wanna get hit so hard.
She think she the main because I keep her by my side.
Double-O, bust down the watch, she know that I'm timeless?
Timeless,
I put my son in some Rick.
I pull that gun off the hip.
Pockets hold twenty-two clips.
I break her heart, Comme Garçon.
Put on a shirt, get put on a blimp.
Bitch like a stain, get ready to lick!
I had to tеll her that ever sincе I was a jit, knew I was the shit.
She singin' my songs, she wanna die lit, tryna get hit.
House like a bank, deposit this bitch, 'posit that check.
Smile on my face, ain't fearing shit, come and get checked.
Ice on my neck, double-O wrist.
She in the Scat, hell of a 'Cat.
Fresh out the trench, four hundred packs.
Uh, yeah, I'm spinnin' in Paris.
Dress for these hoes, they finna flock.
Just poured a four in a soda, it pop.
Them drugs finna hit, I'm feelin' ill.
I'm wrestlin' all of my demons, I feel like The Rock.

Bota na boca, bota na cara, bota onde quiser.
Bota na boca, bota na cara, bota onde quiser.
O novinho me olhou e quis comer minha pepequinha.
Hoje eu vou dar pro novinho, fode, fode a larissinha.
O novinho me olhou e quis comer minha pepequinha.
Hoje eu vou dar pro novinho, fode, fode a larissinha.
Every time I try to run, you put your curse all over me.
I surrender at your feet, baby, put it all on me.
Every time I try to pray you away, you got me on my knees.
I surrender at your feet, baby, put it all on me.
I love it when you turn me on.
I love it when you turn it on.
I love it when you turn me on.
So come back in and turn it on,

Bota na boca, bota na cara, bota onde quiser.
Turn me on,
Turn me on,
O novinho me olhou e quis comer minha pepequinha.

Hoje eu vou dar pro novinho, fode, fode a larissinha.
Turn me on,

Traffic dies while we are racin' home.
Melted lights cover the open road.
I hope we make it 'cause I've been chasin'.
Another odyssey, oh,
I can't wait to see your face.
Crash when we're switchin' lanes.
My love's beyond the pain.
But if I miss the brake,
We're dancin' in the flames.
It's indescribable,
Ooh, yeah,
"The world can't heal," they say on the radio.
So grab the wheel, want you to be in control,
We're dodgin' headlights, and you say, "Hold tight".
Another odyssey, oh,

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through.
I just can't say I don't love you.
'Cause I love you, yeah.
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold.
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know,
Let me tell the truth!
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah!
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes.
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry.
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night.
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time.
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love.
I try to find a reason to pull us apart.
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect.
And I know that you're worth it,
I can't walk away, oh.
Even though we're goin' through it.
And it makes you feel alone,
Just know that I would die for you.
Baby, I would die for you, yeah!
The distance and the time between us.
It'll never change my mind 'cause!
Baby, I would die for you!
Baby, I would die for you, yeah!

Record man play my song on the radio.
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul.
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke.
And I swear too much on the regular,
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go.
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go.
I just won a new award for a kids show.
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow.
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice.
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy!
Whip game, make a nigga understand though.
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo!
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate.
All my niggas blew up like a propane.
All these R&B niggas be so lame.
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein!
You know me, know me, uh,
na-na-na-na-na,
You know me, know me, know me,
oh-oh-oh!
You know me, know me, know me,
na-na-na-na-na,
Every time you try to forget who I am.
I'll be right there to remind you again.
You know me.
You know me.


Hello, it's me!
I was wondering if after all these years, you'd like to meet.
To go over everything!
They say that time's supposed to heal ya.
But I ain't done much healin',
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be.
When we were younger and free?
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet.
There's such a difference between us.
And a million miles,
Hello from the other side!
I must've called a thousand times.
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done!
But when I call, you never seem to be home!
Hello from the outside!
At least I can say that I've tried,
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart,
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore,
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry.
I hope that you're well.
Did you ever make it out of that town?
Where nothing ever happened?

It’s me saying, ‘Get the fuck….
There's a fire starting in my heart.
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare!
See how I'll leave with every piece of you.
Don't underestimate the things that I will do?
There's a fire starting in my heart.
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
The scars of your love remind me of us.
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless.
I can't help feeling.
We could've had it all.
Rolling in the deep,
You had my heart inside of your hand.
And you played it to the beat,
Baby, I have no story to be told!
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.

There ain't no gold in this river.
That I've been washin' my hands in forever!
I know there is hope in these waters.
But I can't bring myself to swim,
When I am drowning in this silence?
Baby, let me in!
Go easy on me, baby!
I was still a child.
Didn't get the chance to?
Feel the world around me.
I had no time to choose what I chose to do.
So go easy on me,
There ain't no room for things to change.
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways?
You can't deny how hard I've tried.
I changed who I was to put you both first.
But now I give up,
Go easy on mе, baby!
I was still a child.
Didn't get the chance to?
Feel thе world around me.
Had no time to choose what I chose to do?
So go easy on me,

I let it fall, my heart.
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
It was dark, and I was over.
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me.
My hands, they were strong.
But my knees were far too weak,
To stand in your arms,
Without falling to your feet,
But there's a side to you,
That I never knew, never knew!
All the things you'd say.
They were never true, never true!
And the games you'd play,
You would always win, always win!
But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face.
Well, it burned while I cried.
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name.
Your name,
When I lay with you?
I could stay there, close my eyes.
Feel you here forever!
You and me together, nothing is better!

I heard that you're settled down.
That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited.
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it,
I had hoped you'd see my face.
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over,
Never mind, I'll find someone like you!
I wish nothing but the best for you, too!
Don't forget me, I beg?
I remember you said.
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.
You know how the time flies.
Only yesterday was the time of our lives.
We were born and raised in a summer haze.
Bound by the surprise of our glory days.

Everybody loves the things you do.
From the way you talk to the way you move,
Everybody here is watching you.
'Cause you feel like home,
you're like a dream come true.
But, if by chance, you're here alone.
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long.
Hoping you're someone I used to know.
You look like a movie, you sound like a song.
My God, this reminds me of when we were young.
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time!
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised.
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless.
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song.
I was so scared to face my fears.
Nobody told me that you'd be here!
And I swear you'd moved overseas,
That's what you said when you left me.

I will leave my heart at the door.
I won't say a word.
They've all been said before, you know.
So why don't we just play pretend,
Like we're not scared of what is coming next.
Or scared of having nothing left?
Look, don't get me wrong.
I know there is no tomorrow.
All I ask is,
If this is my last night with you.
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend.
Give me a memory I can use.
Take me by the hand while we do.
What lovers do?
It matters how this ends.
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty.
It's already in your eyes.
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me,
No one knows me like you do!
And since you're the only one that mattered,
Tell me, who do I run to?

“Skyfall” is the theme song for the twenty-third James Bond film of the same name.
This is the end,
Hold your breath and count to ten.
Feel the Earth move, and then.
Hear my heart burst again.
For this is the end,
I've drowned and dreamt this moment.
So overdue, I owe them,
Swept away, I'm stolen,
Let the sky fall!
When it crumbles?
We will stand tall.
Face it all together,
Let the sky fall!
When it crumbles?
We will stand tall.
Face it all together at Skyfall.
At Skyfall,
Skyfall is where we start.
A thousand miles and poles apart.
Where worlds collide and days are dark?
You may have my number, you can take my name.
But you'll never have my heart!

Adele played guitar on the record, and it was this riff that began the song. She told the….
Just the guitar, okay, cool.
This was all you, none of it me.
You put your hands on, on my body and told me, mmm.
You told me you were ready.
For the big one, for the big jump,
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me, mmm.
That was what you told me.
I'm giving you up,
I've forgiven it all,
You set me free.
Send my love to your new lover.
Treat her better,
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts.
We both know we ain't kids no more.
Send my love to your new lover.
Treat her better,
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts.
We both know we ain't kids no more.

I built a house for a love to grow.
I was so young that it was hard to know.
I'm as lost now as I was back then.
Always make a mess of everything!
It's about time that I face myself.
All I do is bleed into someone else.
Painting walls with all my secret tears.
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears.
But, oh my,
Oh my!
I'll never learn if I never leap!
I'll always yearn if I never speak!
To be loved and love at the highest count,
Means to lose all the things I can't live without.
Let it be known that I will choose to lose!
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie.
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried!
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide.
I'll be the one to catch myself this time.
Tryna learn to lean into it all.
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing.
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning!
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by.
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right.

“I’m still just an…,
You were the shadow to my light.
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away.
Afraid our aim is out of sight.
Wanna see us alight,
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea.
Where are you now? Another dream?
The monster's running wild inside of me.
I'm faded, I'm faded,
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded,
So lost, I'm faded,
These shallow waters never met what I needed!
I'm letting go, a deeper dive.
Eternal silence of the sea.
I'm breathing, alive,

What's the trick? I wish I knew?
I'm so done with thinking through.
All the things I could've been.
And I know you wonder too,
All it takes is that one look you do.
And I run right back to you,
You crossed the line and it's time to say "F you".
What's the point in saying that?
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back.
But shit just don't work like that,
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad.
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that.
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever.
When it don't work out for the better?
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye.
When it all falls down, when it all falls down?
I'll be fine,
I'll be fine,
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad.
But I'll be fine,
[Verse 2: Juliander &,
Noah Cyrus!
Why we fight? I don't know?
We say what hurts the most.
Oh, I try!
staying cold, but you take it personal.
All these firing shots and making ground.
It's way too hard to cope.
, but I still,
can't let you go?

We're not in love,
We share no stories.
Just somethin' in your eyes.
Don't be afraid?
The shadows know me,
Let's leave the world behind!
Take me through the night.
Fall into the dark side.
We don't need the light.
We'll live on the dark side.
I see it, let's feel it.
While we're still young and fearless.
Let go of the light!
Fall into the dark side.
Fall into the dark side.
Give in to the dark side.
Let go of the light!
Fall into the dark side.

I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk.
I need a moment before I go, it's nothing personal!
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry.
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand.
So then, when I'm finished,
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world.
I'm taking my misery, make it my bitch.
Can't be everyone's favorite girl?
So take aim and fire away,
I've never been so wide awake!
No, nobody but me can keep me safe!
And I'm on my way,
The blood moon is on the rise.
The fire burning in my eyes.
No, nobody but me can keep me safe!
And I'm on my way,
Blep, yah, yah,
Farru,
Yah-yah-yah-yah,

Hello, sweet grief!
I know you'll be the death of me.
Feel like the mornin' after ecstasy.
I am drownin' in an endless sea.
Hello, old friend!
Here's the misery that knows no end.
So I'm doin' everything I can!
To make sure I never love again!
I wish that I did not know.
Where all broken lovers go?
I wish that my heart was made of stone.
Yeah, if I was bulletproof!
I'd love you black and blue.
If I was solid like a jewel.
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh.
I'd give you all my love.
If I was unbreakable,
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh.
You could shoot me with a gun of gold.
If I was unbreakable,

We were young, posters on the wall.
Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call.
We would stare at each other.
'Cause we were always in trouble!
And all the cool kids did their own thing.
I was on the outside always looking in!
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't!
They never really cared if I wasn't!
We all need that someone who gets you like no one else.
Right when you need it the most.
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on.
A friend through the highs and the lows.
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone.
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone.
Then I saw your face, your forgiving eyes.
Looking back at me from the other side.
Like you understood me,
And I'm never letting you go, oh!

Lost in your mind,
I wanna know.
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go!
If this night is not forever!
At least we are together,
I know I'm not alone.
I know I'm not alone.
Anywhere, whenever!
Apart, but still together,
I know I'm not alone.
I know I'm not alone.
I know I'm not alone.
I know I'm not alone.
Unconscious mind,
I'm wide awake,
Wanna feel one last time.
Take my pain away,

The song’s…,
Woah,
Eyes up, you've been gone for a fortnight.
My love, are you stuck in a fake life?
Can't win, if the prize is to waste your time?
Now it's wasting mine!
And I know that we're close, but I'm lonely,
Make me your only, won't win a trophy.
But can it kiss you like this when you hold me?
Missing it lowkey, I'll say it slowly.
It's me or the PS5.
Tell me how you wanna spend your night.
Three's feeling way too tight.
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over,
Me or the PS5,
Tell me which of us is more your type.
Seems like you can't decide.
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over,
Oh-oh!

I see those tears in your eyes.
I feel so helpless inside.
Oh love, there's no need to hide!
Just let me love you when your heart is tired.
Cold hands, red eyes,
Packed two bags at midnight.
They've been there for weeks.
You don't know what goodbye means.
Just roll up a cigarette.
Just forget about this mess.
I'm waiting on the sidelines.
From the sidelines,
I see those tears in your eyes.
And I feel so helpless inside,
Oh love, there's no need to hide!
Just let me love you when your heart is tired.
If your ghost pulls you apart.
And it feels like you've lost who you are,
My love, there's no need to hide.
Just let me love you when your heart is tired.

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah!
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah!
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world.
Y-y-y-you think you're so small like you're itty-bitty.
Just one match in the lights of the city.
Walkin' by strangers on the side of the street.
Like a quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like.
You think you're never gonna make your mark!
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like.
Out of sight, out of m-m-m-mind, like.
Like it's just a waste of time, like-like-like.
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, yeah, yeah,
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world.
I said.
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, yeah, yeah,
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls.
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah!
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah!
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world.

Hey,
I know what I came to do.
And that ain't gonna change,
So go ahead and talk your talk,
'Cause I won't take the bait.
I'm over here doin' what I like.
I'm over here workin' day and night.
And if my real ain't real enough,
I'm sorry for you, babe.
Let's find a light inside our universe now!
Where ain't nobody keep on holdin' us down?
Just come and get it, let them say what they say.
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, woo.
[Chorus: Jamie Foxx &,
Ariana Grande,
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo.
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo.
Focus on me (,
Focus,
), f-f-focus on me, woo (.
Focus on me,
Focus on me (,
Focus,
), f-f-focus on me, woo (.
Focus on me,
I can tell you're curious.
It's written on your lips.
Ain't no need to hold it back.
Go 'head and talk your shit!
I know you're hopin' that I'll react.
I know you're hopin' I'm lookin' back.
But if my real ain't real enough,
Then I don't know what is.

Oh, yeah!
Don't need permission?
Made my decision to test my limits.
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness.
Start what I finished,
Don't need no hold up?
Taking control of this kind of moment.
I'm locked and loaded,
Completely focused, my mind is open.
All that you got,
Skin to skin, oh my God.
Don't you stop, boy?
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman.
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you.
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't.
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout.
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and!
Know what I'm doing,
The way we're movin',
Like introducing us to a new thing.
I wanna savor, save it for later.
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver.
It's only nature, I live for danger.

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles!
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble.
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines.
Buy myself all of my favorite things.
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch.
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings.
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah.
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy.
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'.
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it.
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it.
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it.
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it.
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it.
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it.
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs.".
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches.
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches.
Think retail therapy my new addiction.
Whoever said money can't solve your problems.
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em.
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em".
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms.

Thought I'd end up with Sean.
But he wasn't a match,
Wrote some songs about Ricky.
Now I listen and laugh!
Even almost got married,
And for Pete, I'm so thankful,
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm.
'Cause he was an angel.
One taught me love,
One taught me patience,
And one taught me pain,
Now, I'm so amazing!
Say I've loved and I've lost.
But that's not what I see,
So, look what I got.
Look what you taught me.
And for that, I say,
Thank you, next,
Thank you, next,
Thank you, next,
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex.
Thank you, next,
Thank you, next,
Thank you, next,
I'm so fuckin'—,

You got me some type of way.
Ain't used to feelin' this way.
I do not know what to say.
But I know I shouldn't think about it,
Took one fuckin' look at your face.
Now I wanna know how you taste!
Usually don't give it away.
But you know I'm already thinkin' 'bout it,
Then I realize she's right there.
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair",
Break up with your girlfriend.
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored!
You could hit it in the mornin'.
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours!
I know it ain't right, but I don't care.
Break up with your girlfriend.
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored!
This shit always happen to me!
Why can't we just play for keeps?
Practically on my knees,
But I know I shouldn't think about it,
You know what you're doin' to me.
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah.
Actin' all innocent, please,
When I know you already thinkin' 'bout it?

Mmm,
Hey, yeah,
I'm stuck with you,
I'm not one to stick around.
One strike and you're out, baby.
Don't care if I sound crazy?
But you never let me down, no, no!
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'.
Still layin' in your bed, singin'.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Got all this time on our hands!
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah.
I could stay here for a lifetime.
So, lock the door and throw out the key.
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me?
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do,
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you.
So, go ahead and drive me insane.
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change!
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you.
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby.

I didn't ask for a free ride.
I only asked you to show me a real good time.
I never asked for the rainfall!
At least I showed up, you showed me nothin' at all,
It's comin' down on me.
Water like misery,
It's comin' down on me.
I'm ready, rain on me.
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive.
Rain on me, rain, rain.
Rain on me, rain, rain.
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive.
Rain on me, rain, rain.
Rain on me,
[Drop: Lady Gaga,
Ariana Grande,
Rain on me,
Mm, oh yeah, baby,
Rain on me,
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent.
Oh, but at least we try, mm!
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in!
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah,

Heaven sent you to me.
I'm just hopin’ I don't repeat history.
Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday.
Then make a lotta love on a Monday.
Never need no , no one else, babe!
’Cause I'll be,
Switchin' them positions for you.
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom.
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops.
Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do.
That I won't do, switchin’ for you.
Perfect, perfect,
You're too good to be true.
But I get tired of runnin', fuck it,
Now, I’m runnin' with you!
Said, boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday.
Then make a lotta love on a Monday.
Never need no , no onе else, babe!
'Causе I'll be,

In case you haven't noticed,
Well, everybody's tired,
And healin' from somebody!
Or somethin' we don't see just right,
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on.
Come on and walk this way through the fire!
And if you find yourself in a dark situation,
Just turn on your light and be like.
"Yes, and?",
Say that shit with your chest, and.
Be your own fuckin' best friend.
Say that shit with your chest.
Keep moving like, "What's next?".
"Yes, and?",
Now, I'm so done with caring!
What you think, no, I won't hide?
Underneath your own projections,
Or change my most authentic life,

You, you love it how I move you.
You love it how I touch you, my one.
When all is said and done?
You'll believe God is a woman.
And I, I feel it after midnight,
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one.
It lingers when we're done.
You'll believe God is a woman.
I don't wanna waste no time, yeah.
Have it any way you like, yeah?
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it,
Ain't nobody else can relate!
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid.
Baby, lay me down and let's pray!
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it.
And I can be all the things you told me not to be,
When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing?
And he see the universe when I'm the company,
It's all in me,

[Intro: Ariana Grande &,
Nicki Minaj,
I've been here all night.
I've been here all day.
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side.
I'm talkin' to ya,
See you standing over there with your body.
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body.
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin',
I'm comin' at ya,
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation.
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation?
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin',
These friends keep talkin' way too much.
Say I should give you up.
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I—?
I've been here all night.
I've been here all day.
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side.
I've been here all night.
I've been here all day.
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side.

Right now, I'm in a state of mind.
I wanna be in like all the time.
Ain't got no tears left to cry.
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up.
I'm lovin', I'm livin' , I'm pickin' it up.
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up.
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up.
I'm pickin' it up , pickin' it up.
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up.
Yeah, we turnin' it up!
Ain't got no tears in my body.
I ran out, but, boy, I like it.
I like it, I like it.
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it?
We out here vibin'.
We vibin', we vibin'.
Comin' out,
Even when it's rainin' down.
Can't stop now?
Can't stop so shut your mouth?
Shut your mouth,
And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe,
Know it, babe, yeah,

Hmm,
You might think I'm crazy.
The way I've been cravin'.
If I put it quite plainly.
Just gimme them babies,
So what you doin' tonight?
Better say, "Doin' you right".
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight.
I don't wanna keep you up.
But show me, can you keep it up?
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up.
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy!
I've been drinkin' coffee,
And I've been eatin' healthy,
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah.
Savin' up my energy,
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight!
Thirty-four, thirty-five,
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight!
Thirty-four, thirty-five,

I think a lot….
​​lacigam gnihtemos od oT,
​​thgin laiceps ruoy s'thginot tuB.
Some days, things just take.
Way too much of my energy.
I look up and the whole room's spinning.
You take my cares away.
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate.
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'.
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm.
Time goes by and I can't control my mind.
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time?
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'.
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin',
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'.
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm,
Sometimes, it's hard to find.
Find my way up into the clouds.
Tune it out, they can be so loud.
You remind me of a time.
When things weren't so complicated?
All I need is to see your face.

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire.
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest.
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you.
I should've done you better 'cause you don't want a liar.
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything!
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you.
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything!
But I got nothin' here without you,
So, one last time,
I need to be the one who takes you home.
One more time,
I promise after that, I'll let you go.
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart!
All I really care is you wake up in my arms.
One last time,
I need to be the one who takes you home.
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it.
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it,
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily?
I know that this is my fault, I should've been more careful.

I've been watchin' you for some time.
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes?
Burning cities and napalm skies.
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes.
Your ocean eyes,
No fair!
You really know how to make me cry.
When you give me those ocean eyes?
I'm scared,
I've never fallen from quite this high!
Fallin' into your ocean eyes.
Those ocean eyes,
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind.
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind?
Careful creature made friends with time.
He left her lonely with a diamond mind.
And those ocean eyes,
No fair!
You really know how to make me cry.
When you give me those ocean eyes?
I'm scared,
I've never fallen from quite this high!
Fallin' into your ocean eyes.
Those ocean eyes,

Help, I lost myself again.
But I remember you,
Don't come back, it won't end well?
But I wish you'd tell me to,
Our love is six feet under.
I can't help but wonder.
If our grave was watered by the rain.
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch.
It's all too much for me.
Blow away like smoke in air.
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under.
I can't help but wonder.
If our grave was watered by the rain.
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose.
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes.
Creepin' around like no one knows.
Think you're so criminal,
Bruises on both my knees for you.
Don't say thank you or please?
I do what I want when I'm wanting to.
My soul? So cynical,
So you're a tough guy,
Like it really rough guy.
Just can't get enough guy.
Chest always so puffed guy!
I'm that bad type,
Make your mama sad type.
Make your girlfriend mad tight.
Might seduce your dad type.
I'm the bad guy,
Duh,
I'm the bad guy,
I like it when you take control.
Even if you know that you don't.
Own me, I'll let you play the role.
I'll be your animal,
My mommy likes to sing along with me.
She'll pity the men I know.

I should have known.
I'd leave alone,
Just goes to show,
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe.
We were a pair,
But I saw you there,
Too much to bear,
You were my life, but life is far away from fair.
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie.
You were never on my side!
Fool me once, fool me twice.
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry!
There's just no time to die.
I let it burn.
You're no longer my concern, mmm.
Faces from my past return.
Another lesson yet to learn.

I had a dream.
I got everything I wanted!
Not what you'd think!
And if I'm bein' honest,
It might've been a nightmare.
To anyone who might care.
Thought I could fly,
So I stepped off the Golden, mm,
Nobody cried!
Nobody even noticed!
I saw them standing right there.
Kinda thought they might care.
I had a dream.
I got everything I wanted!
But when I wake up, I see,
You with me.
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you,
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to?
If I could change the way that you see yourself.
You wouldn't wonder why you hear.
'They don't deserve you'",

When I'm away from you?
I'm happier than ever,
Wish I could explain it better.
I wish it wasn't true.
Give me a day or two to think of something clever.
To write myself a letter,
To tell me what to do, mm-mm,
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through?
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to.
Be cool about what I was tellin' you.
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do.
And I'd end up more afraid,
Don't say it isn't fair?
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable.
So if you really wanna know,
When I'm away from you?
I'm happier than ever,
Wish I could explain it better.
I wish it wasn't true.
, mm-mm,

I don't wanna talk right now.
I just wanna watch TV.
I'll stay in the pool and drown.
So I don't have to watch you leave,
I put on.
Survivor,
just to watch somebody suffer!
Maybe I should get some sleep.
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other.
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again.
That's what happens when you fall in love.
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind.
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love".
Don't know where you are right now?
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself.
Just because you're mad at me.
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while,
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial.
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade.

Sometimes, you look the same.
Just like you did before the accident.
When you're starin' into space?
It's hard to believe you don't remember it.
Woke up in the ambulance.
You pieced it all together on the drive.
I know you don't remember calling me.
But I told you even then you looked so pretty,
In a hospital bed, I remember you said,
You were scared.
And so was I,
In a standstill on the 5,
Thought it was unusually early traffic.
Usually, I don't panic,
I just wanted to be on time.
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder?
I didn't even think of pullin' over.
I pieced it all together late that night.
And I know you don't remember calling me,
But I told you even then you looked so pretty,
In a hospital bed, I remember you said,
You were scared.
And so was I,

I used to float, now I just fall down.
I used to know, but I'm not sure now.
What I was made for?
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal.
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real.
Just somethin' you paid for.
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I,
I don't know how to feel.
But I wanna try,
I don't know how to feel.
But someday, I might,
Someday, I might,
Mm, mm, ah,
Mm, mm, mm,
When did it end? All the enjoyment?
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend.
It's not what he's made for.
What was I made for?

Oh, mm-mm!
I could eat that girl for lunch.
Yeah, she dances on my tongue!
Tastes like she might be the one.
And I could never get enough!
I could buy her so much stuff.
It's a craving, not a crush, huh.
"Call me when you're there".
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare.
And I left it under 'Claire'",
So now, she's comin' up the stairs,
So I'm pullin' up a chair,
And I'm puttin' up my hair,
Baby, I think you were made for me!
Somebody write down the recipe!
Been tryin' hard not to overeat.
You're just so sweet,
I'll run a shower for you like you want.
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on.
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off.
Huh,

To take my love away,
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name.
Not today, not tomorrow!
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow,
I got change , you could borrow.
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow!
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more.
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store.
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
Did you take?
My love away,
From me? Me,
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away.
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face.
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break".
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

I want you to stay.
'Til I'm in the grave.
'Til I rot away, dead and buried.
'Til I'm in the casket you carry.
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh.
'Cause it was always you!
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me,
Nothin' left to lose without my baby!
Birds of a feather, we should stick together.
, I know,
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone!
Can't change the weather, might not be forever?
But if it's forever, it's even better!
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for,
I don't think I could love you more.
It might not be long, but baby, I.
I'll love you 'til the day that I die.
'Til the day that I die.
'Til the light leaves my eyes.
'Til the day that I die.

I wish you the best for the rest of your life.
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes.
But I need to confess, I told you a lie,
I said you.
You were the love of my life.
The love of my life.
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you.
Then you tried to break mine.
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology.
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave,
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me!
Then you moved on immediately.
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life,
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes.
But I need to confess, I told you a lie,
When I said you?
You  were the love of my life.
The love of my life.

Uh-uh,
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear.
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there.
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south.
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about.
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south.
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about.
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it.
Pull it to the side and get all up in it.
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it.
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it.
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it.
Pull it to the side and get all up in it.
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it.
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious.
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear?
Already know what you've got goin' on down there.
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows.
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo.
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out.
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about.

The…,
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish &.
Khalid,
Thought I found a way.
Thought I found a way out (.
Found,
But you never go away (!
Never go away!
So I guess I gotta stay now,
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here!
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear.
[Chorus: Billie Eilish,
with Khalid,
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone.
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone.
Hello, welcome home!
[Verse 2: Khalid,
with Billie Eilish,
Walking out of time,
Looking for a better place.
Something's on my mind,
Always in my head space!
But I know someday I'll make it out of here,
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear.

Things fall apart,
And time breaks your heart,
I wasn't there, but I know.
She was your girl.
You showed her the world.
But fell out of love and you both let go,
She was cryin’ on my shoulder.
All I could do was hold her.
Only made us closer until July.
Now, I know that you love me!
You don't need to remind me.
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time,
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign.
Did I cross the line?
Hmm,
Well, good things don't last.
And life moves so fast,
I'd never ask who was better!
'Cause she couldn't be,
More different from me,
Happy and free in leather.

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to.
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'.
But nothin' ever stops you leavin',
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own.
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me.
Call me friend, but keep me closer.
And I'll call you when the party's over,
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own.
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that,
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that!
But nothin' is better sometimes,
Once we've both said our goodbyes.
Let's just let it go!
Let me let you go!

Ba-da-da-da-da,
Ba-da-da-da-da,
Don't be that way?
Fall apart twice a day.
I just wish you could feel what you say.
Show, never tell!
But I know you too well,
Got a mood that you wish you could sell!
If teardrops could be bottled.
There'd be swimming pools filled by models.
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore".
f "I love you" was a promise.
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before.
I don't wanna be you.
Anymore,
Hands getting cold,
Losing feeling is getting old.
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake,
We've made every mistake,
Only you know the way that I break.

It's not true,
Tell me I’ve been lied to.
Crying isn't like you, ooh.
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to!
Let someone see right through, ooh!
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh.
And nothing has to change today!
You didn’t mean to say "I love you".
I love you and I don't want to, ooh.
Up all night on another red-eye.
I wish we never learned to fly!
Maybe we should just try.
To tell ourselves a good lie,
Didn't mean to make you cry?
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh.
And nothing has to change today!
You didn't mean to say "I love you".
I love you and I don't want to, ooh.

Billie,
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish &.
Mehki Raine,
Come here!
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly.
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly.
The way I'm drinkin' you down.
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me.
Step on the glass, staple your tongue.
Bury a friend, try to wake up.
Cannibal class, killing the son?
Bury a friend, I wanna end me.
I wanna end me.
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me.
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna….

I've been watchin' you for some time.
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes?

No fair!
You really know how to make me cry.
When you give me those ocean eyes?
I'm scared,
I've never fallen from quite this high!
Fallin' into your ocean eyes.
Those ocean eyes,

Help, I lost myself again.
But I remember you,
Don't come back, it won't end well?
But I wish you'd tell me to,
Our love is six feet under.
I can't help but wonder.
If our grave was watered by the rain.
Would roses bloom?

I had a dream.
I got everything I wanted!
Not what you'd think!
And if I'm bein' honest,
It might've been a nightmare.
To anyone who might care.
Thought I could fly,
So I stepped off the Golden, mm,
Nobody cried!
Nobody even noticed!
I saw them standing right there.
Kinda thought they might care.
I had a dream.
I got everything I wanted!
But when I wake up, I see,
You with me.
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you,
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to?
If I could change the way that you see yourself.
You wouldn't wonder why you hear.
'They don't deserve you'",

When I'm away from you?
I'm happier than ever,
Wish I could explain it better.
I wish it wasn't true.
Give me a day or two to think of something clever.
To write myself a letter,
To tell me what to do, mm-mm,
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through?
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to.
Be cool about what I was tellin' you.
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do.
And I'd end up more afraid,
Don't say it isn't fair?
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable.
So if you really wanna know,
When I'm away from you?
I'm happier than ever,
Wish I could explain it better.
I wish it wasn't true.
, mm-mm,

I don't wanna talk right now.
I just wanna watch TV.
I'll stay in the pool and drown.
So I don't have to watch you leave,
I put on.
Survivor,
just to watch somebody suffer!
Maybe I should get some sleep.
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other.
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again.
That's what happens when you fall in love.
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind.
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love".
Don't know where you are right now?
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself.
Just because you're mad at me.
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while,
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial.
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade.

Sometimes, you look the same.
Just like you did before the accident.
When you're starin' into space?
It's hard to believe you don't remember it.
Woke up in the ambulance.
You pieced it all together on the drive.
I know you don't remember calling me.
But I told you even then you looked so pretty,
In a hospital bed, I remember you said,
You were scared.
And so was I,
In a standstill on the 5,
Thought it was unusually early traffic.
Usually, I don't panic,
I just wanted to be on time.
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder?
I didn't even think of pullin' over.
I pieced it all together late that night.
And I know you don't remember calling me,
But I told you even then you looked so pretty,
In a hospital bed, I remember you said,
You were scared.
And so was I,

I used to float, now I just fall down.
I used to know, but I'm not sure now.
What I was made for?
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal.
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real.
Just somethin' you paid for.
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I,
I don't know how to feel.
But I wanna try,
I don't know how to feel.
But someday, I might,
Someday, I might,
Mm, mm, ah,
Mm, mm, mm,
When did it end? All the enjoyment?
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend.
It's not what he's made for.
What was I made for?

Oh, mm-mm!
I could eat that girl for lunch.
Yeah, she dances on my tongue!
Tastes like she might be the one.
And I could never get enough!
I could buy her so much stuff.
It's a craving, not a crush, huh.
"Call me when you're there".
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare.
And I left it under 'Claire'",
So now, she's comin' up the stairs,
So I'm pullin' up a chair,
And I'm puttin' up my hair,
Baby, I think you were made for me!
Somebody write down the recipe!
Been tryin' hard not to overeat.
You're just so sweet,
I'll run a shower for you like you want.
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on.
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off.
Huh,

To take my love away,
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name.
Not today, not tomorrow!
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow,
I got change , you could borrow.
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow!
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more.
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store.
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
Did you take?
My love away,
From me? Me,
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away.
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face.
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break".
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

I want you to stay.
'Til I'm in the grave.
'Til I rot away, dead and buried.
'Til I'm in the casket you carry.
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh.
'Cause it was always you!
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me,
Nothin' left to lose without my baby!
Birds of a feather, we should stick together.
, I know,
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone!
Can't change the weather, might not be forever?
But if it's forever, it's even better!
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for,
I don't think I could love you more.
It might not be long, but baby, I.
I'll love you 'til the day that I die.
'Til the day that I die.
'Til the light leaves my eyes.
'Til the day that I die.

I wish you the best for the rest of your life.
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes.
But I need to confess, I told you a lie,
I said you.
You were the love of my life.
The love of my life.
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you.
Then you tried to break mine.
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology.
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave,
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me!
Then you moved on immediately.
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life,
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes.
But I need to confess, I told you a lie,
When I said you?
You  were the love of my life.
The love of my life.

Uh-uh,
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear.
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there.
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south.
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about.
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south.
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about.
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it.
Pull it to the side and get all up in it.
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it.
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it.
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it.
Pull it to the side and get all up in it.
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it.
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious.
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear?
Already know what you've got goin' on down there.
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows.
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo.
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out.
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about.

Thought I found a way.
Thought I found a way out (.
Found,
But you never go away (!
Never go away!
So I guess I gotta stay now,
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here!
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear.
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone.
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone.
Hello, welcome home!
Walking out of time,
Looking for a better place.
Something's on my mind,
Always in my head space!
But I know someday I'll make it out of here,
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years.
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near.
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear.

Things fall apart,
And time breaks your heart,
I wasn't there, but I know.
She was your girl.
You showed her the world.
But fell out of love and you both let go,
She was cryin’ on my shoulder.
All I could do was hold her.
Only made us closer until July.
Now, I know that you love me!
You don't need to remind me.
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time,
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign.
Did I cross the line?
Hmm,
Well, good things don't last.
And life moves so fast,
I'd never ask who was better!
'Cause she couldn't be,
More different from me,
Happy and free in leather.

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to.
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'.
But nothin' ever stops you leavin',
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own.
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that.
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me.
Call me friend, but keep me closer.
And I'll call you when the party's over,
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own.
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that,
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that!
But nothin' is better sometimes,
Once we've both said our goodbyes.
Let's just let it go!
Let me let you go!

Ba-da-da-da-da,
Ba-da-da-da-da,
Don't be that way?
Fall apart twice a day.
I just wish you could feel what you say.
Show, never tell!
But I know you too well,
Got a mood that you wish you could sell!
If teardrops could be bottled.
There'd be swimming pools filled by models.
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore".
f "I love you" was a promise.
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before.
I don't wanna be you.
Anymore,
Hands getting cold,
Losing feeling is getting old.
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake,
We've made every mistake,
Only you know the way that I break.

It's not true,
Tell me I’ve been lied to.
Crying isn't like you, ooh.
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to!
Let someone see right through, ooh!
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh.
And nothing has to change today!
You didn’t mean to say "I love you".
I love you and I don't want to, ooh.
Up all night on another red-eye.
I wish we never learned to fly!
Maybe we should just try.
To tell ourselves a good lie,
Didn't mean to make you cry?
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh.
And nothing has to change today!
You didn't mean to say "I love you".
I love you and I don't want to, ooh.

Billie,
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish &.
Mehki Raine,
Come here!
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly.
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly.
The way I'm drinkin' you down.
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me.
Step on the glass, staple your tongue.
Bury a friend, try to wake up.
Cannibal class, killing the son?
Bury a friend, I wanna end me.
I wanna end me.
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me.
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna….

I might.
Empty my bank account,
And buy that boy with a pipe,
Buy that boy with a pipe.
I might, I might.
Empty my bank account,
And buy that boy with a pipe,
Buy that boy with a pipe.
I might.
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the slide.
Whatever comes, comes through clear?
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side.
And whatever comes, comes through clear,
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark.
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far.
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms.
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms.
Layin', we're still a link apart.
It's like we could die here all young.
Like we could dye hair all blonde, huh.
If we could see in twenty twin.
Twice we could see it 'til the end.

Hey!
Now nothing ever last forever, no!
One minute you're here and the next you're gone.
So I respect you, wanna take it slow,
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe.
And do you mind if I steal a kiss?
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me,
The way you move it here.
Just wanna feel it from you.
Don't be afraid to catch feels?
Ride drop top and chase thrills.
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills.
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels!
Feels with me,
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh.
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality.
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar.
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity.

Ah-ooh, ooh, ah-ooh,
I want you to breathe me in.
Let me be your air!
Let me roam your body freely!
No inhibition, no fear!
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?
Hit me harder again,
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer again,
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh,
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh,

Are you drunk enough?
Not to judge what I'm doin’?
Are you high enough?
To excuse that I'm ruined? 'Cause I’m ruined,
Is it late enough?
For you to come and stay over?
'Cause we're free to love.
So tease me, ooh,
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings.
But I'll give you everything
Tonight,
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here.
So come get your everything
Tonight,
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings.
But I'll give you everything
Tonight,
Magic is in the air, there ain’t no science here.
So come get your everything
Tonight,
Tonight,
Your everything tonight, uh!
Is it loud enough?
’Cause my body is callin' for ya, callin’ for ya.
I need someone.
To do the things that I do, mhm,
I'm heatin' up,
Energy's takin’ control,
I'm speedin' up,
My heartbeat's dancin' alone,

When I met you in the summer?
To my heartbeat's sound,
We fell in love.
As the leaves turned brown.
And we could be together, baby,
As long as skies are blue.
You act so innocent now.
But you lied so soon,
When I met you in the summer?
When I met you in the summer?
To my heartbeat's sound,
We fell in love.
As the leaves turned brown.
And we could be together, baby,
As long as skies are blue.
You act so innocent now.
But you lied so soon,
When I met you in the summer?
Summer,

I've been rollin' on the freeway.
I've been riding 85,
I've been thinking way too much.
And I'm way too gone to drive,
I've got anger in my chest.
I've got millions on my mind.
And you didn't fit the picture,
So I guess you weren't the vibe,
I've been rollin' on the freeway.
I've been riding 85,
I've been thinking way too much.
And I'm way too gone to drive,
I've got anger in my chest.
I've got millions on my mind.
And you didn't fit the picture,
So I guess you weren't the vibe,
Got L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci!
Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci!
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn.
They deserve Whammys, they imposters.
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe.
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe.
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah.

Baby, this is what you came for!
Lightning strikes every time she moves.
And everybody's watchin' her,
But she's lookin' at,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Baby, this is what you came for!
Lightning strikes every time she moves.
And everybody's watchin' her,
But she's lookin' at,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh.
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh.
We go fast with the game we play.
Who knows why it's gotta be this way.
We say nothin' more than we need.
I say, "Your place" when we leave.
Baby, this is what you came for!
Lightning strikes every time she moves.
And everybody's watchin' her,
But she's lookin' at,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh.
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh,
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh.

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf.
Now when I lean on you and I got nothin' left!
Hey, I've been wantin' to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry.
Same old fucking story everybody sing.
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar,
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it.
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it.
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you cryin'.
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby.
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby.
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby.
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby.
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else!
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself.
, ay,
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya.
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell.

Four of hip-hop’s heavyweights take turns going in over a hard beat by Boi-1da.

I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah.
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life.
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice.
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing.
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string.
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you!

Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message.
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon.
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97.
Woah—very important and very pretentious.
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention?
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience!
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options!
I wanna see my niggas go insane.

You love her, then you gotta give the world to her.

Another key subject of the song is….
And they wishin' and wishin',
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me,
Yeah!

Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me.
Don't pull up at 6 a.m. to cuddle with me?
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me.
I don't wanna die for them to miss me.
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me!

Bad things,
It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'.
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me,
Bad things,
It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'.
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me,
Yeah, ayy, ayy!

Trap, TrapMoneyBenny,
This shit got me in my feelings.
Gotta be real with it, yeah!
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me!
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya.
And I'm down for you always!
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me!
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya.
And I'm down for you always!
Look, the new me is really still the real me.
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me.
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options.
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'.
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin',
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it,
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it,
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it.
TrapMoneyBenny, ayy,
I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny.
From the block like you Jenny,
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many.

You used to call me on my.
You used to, you used to.
Yeah!
You used to call me on my cell phone.
Late-night when you need my love.
Call me on my cell phone.
Late-night when you need my love.
And I know when that hotline bling,
That can only mean one thing.
I know when that hotline bling.
That can only mean one thing.
Ever since I left the city, you.
Got a reputation for yourself now!
Everybody knows and I feel left out.
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out.
'Cause ever since I left the city, you.
Started wearin' less and goin' out more.
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor.
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before!
You used to call me on my cell phone.
Late-night when you need my love.
Call me on my cell phone.
Late-night when you need, my love.
I know when that hotline bling.
That can only mean one thing.
I know when that hotline bling.
That can only mean one thing.

Baby, I like your style!
Grips on your waist, front way, back way.
You know that I don't play.
Streets not safe but I never run away!
Even when I'm away,
Oti, oti,
There's never much love when we go OT!
I pray to make it back in one piece.
I pray, I pray.
That's why I need a one dance.
Got a Hennessy in my hand!
One more time 'fore I go.
Higher powers taking a hold on me.
I need a one dance.
Got a Hennessy in my hand!
One more time 'fore I go.
Higher powers taking a hold on me.
Baby, I like your style!

I got my eyes on you.
You're everything that I see!
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly.
I can't get over you.
You left your mark on me.
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly.
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it.
You act so different around me.
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it.
I know exactly who you could be.
Just hold on, we're going home.
Just hold on, we're going home.
It's hard to do these things alone.
Just hold on, we're going home.
Home,
I got my eyes on you.
You're everything that I see!
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly.
I can't get over you.
You left your mark on me.
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly.

Hol' it yute, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it, hol' it.
No sleepin' in the streets!
Shaky warrior,
Yeah, this that Oliver, 40, Niko shit man!
15 Fort York shit, y'know?
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah!
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes.
Countin' money, you know how it goes.
Pray the real live forever, man!
Pray the fakes get exposed.
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve.
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt.
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose.
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it.
I don't like how serious they take themselves.
I've always been me, I guess I know myself!
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that.
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that.
This been where you find me at.
That's been where you find me at.
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling.
He put me on to the finer things.
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans?
I had a yellow TechnoMarine.
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks.
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback.
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags.
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes.

‘New Love’ might sound like a classic tale of unrequited love. 
A fool that continues to go down the path of heartbreak, 
in the knowledge that they are fighting a losing game. 
But at the time I was writing….
Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue!
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth,
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth.
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do,
I don't wanna waste no time all alone.
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own!
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore.
And I've been through mountains and seas,
Tryna get you to come back to me.
And I've been far, and I've been so deep,
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe!
And I need some new love,
New love, new love,
Even though I've run away, I still come back.
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said!
I've been trying to explain the things we had.
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad,

I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon.
Oh, when you're looking at the sun!
You're not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool.
No, you're not fooling anyone!
Oh, but when you're gone, when you're gone, when you're gone!
Oh, baby, all the lights go out!
Thinking now that maybe I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong.
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out!
Oh, baby, come on, let me get to know you!
Just another chance so that I can show.
That I won't let you down and run.
No, I won't let you down and run!
'Cause I could be the one.
I could be the one.
I could be the one.
I could be the one.
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue.
Oh, when you see everything in red!
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you, do for you, do for you!
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head!

The song was released as….
He calls me the devil.
I make him wanna sin.
Every time I knock,
He can't help but let me in.
Must be homesick for the real.
I'm the realest it gets.
You'd probably still adore me.
With my hands around your neck,
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah?
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol.
Where I'm coming from, yeah?
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb.
'Cause we're hot like hell.
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself,
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven.
And I'll give it to you,
Hotter than hell,
Hotter than hell,

I know it's hot.
I know we've got.
Something that money can't buy.
Fighting in fits,
Biting your lip,
Loving till late in the night.
Tell me I'm too crazy.
You can't tame me, can't tame me.
Tell me I have changed.
But I'm the same me, oh, same me,
Inside,
If you don't like the way I talk.
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock.
Then finish your glass of wine.
We fight and we argue.
You'll still love me blind.
If we don't fuck this whole thing up.
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah.
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign,
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah.
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign,
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah.

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy.
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me.
My love,
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else!
But my love,
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself.
One, don't pick up the phone.
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone.
Two, don't let him in.
You'll have to kick him out again.
Three, don't be his friend.
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'.
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him,
I got new rules, I count 'em.
I got new rules, I count 'em.
I gotta tell them to myself.
I got new rules, I count 'em.
I gotta tell them to myself.

You call me all friendly.
Tellin' me how much you miss me.
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs.
Well, I'm too busy for your business.
Go find a girl who wants to listen!
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong.
So I cut you off,
I don't need your love.
'Cause I already cried enough.
I've been done,
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye.
I cut you off.
I don't need your love.
So you can try all you want,
Your time is up, I'll tell you why.
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now.
So save it, get gone, shut up,
'Cause if you think I care about you now.
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck.
I remember that weekend.
When my best friend caught you creepin'?
You blamed it all on the alcohol.
So, I made my decision.
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it.
Play the victim and switch your position.
I'm through, I'm done,

One kiss is all it takes.
Fallin' in love with me.
Possibilities,
I look like all you need.
Let me take the night, I love real easy!
And I know that you'll still wanna see me,
On the Sunday morning, music real loud,
Let me love you while the moon is still out!
Something in you-ou-ou,
Lit up heaven in me-e-e.
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep.
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel.
One kiss is all it takes.
Fallin' in love with me.
Possibilities,
I look like all you need.
One kiss is all it takes.
Fallin' in love with me.
Possibilities,
I look like all you need.

If you don't wanna see me.
Did a full one-eighty, crazy?
Thinking 'bout the way I was.
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe?
But look at where I ended up,
I'm all good already,
So moved on, it's scary,
I'm not where you left me at all, so.
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody!
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me.
Don't show up, don't come out?
Don't start caring about me now?
Walk away, you know how.
Don't start caring about me now?
Aren't you the guy who tried to?
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you.
I'm better on the other side.

The song fits perfectly with….
Common love isn't for us.
We created something phenomenal.
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich.
Nothing on this planet compares to it!
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
All night, I'll riot with you.
I know you got my back and you know I got you.
So come on , come on , come on,
Let's get physical!
Lights out, follow the noise.
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice!
So come on , come on , come on,
Let's get physical!
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in.
Love the simulation we're dreaming in!
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life.
'Cause this one's pretty nice.
Living it up,

It was….
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye!
Had to love and lose a hundred million times?
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like?
Now I'm falling!
You say my name like I have never heard before!
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure.
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all.
Are you falling?
Centre of attention,
You know you can get whatever you want from me.
Whenever you want it, baby?
It's you in my reflection.
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me.
If I would've known it, baby.
I would've stayed at home.
'Cause I was doing better alone.
But when you said, "Hello",
I knew that was the end of it all.
I should've stayed at home.
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go.
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone!
But when you said, "Hello",
I knew that was the end of it all.
I should've stayed at home.
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go.
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Bad Bunny,
You know that sometimes I think about us now and then.
But I never wanna fall again, ah!
Yo no te quisiera olvidar.
Eh-eh,
Pero contigo es todo o na'.
-eh,
Yeah-yeah!
You're deep in the water, yeah, you're drownin' us.
You question my love like it's not enough.
But I hate that you know, you know, you know,
You got me tied up.
You regret it now, but it's your mistake.
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know,
You know you messed up.
One day you'll love me again.
One day you'll love me for sure.
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'.
Baby, you'll knock at my door!
One day you'll love me again.
Hug me again till the end.
One day you'll beg me to try.
One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover.
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend.

It was great at the very start.
Hands on each other,
Couldn't stand to be far apart?
Closer the better,
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors!
Magnifying all our flaws,
And I wonder why, wonder what for,
Why we keep coming back for more?
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight?
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight?
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch.
Forgot how it feels,

If you wanna,
run away with me, I know a galaxy.
And I can take you for a ride,
I had a premonition that we.
fell into,
a rhythm,
Where the music don't stop for life?
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes.
Shining just the way I like.
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company.
You met me at the perfect time.
You want me, I want you, baby.
My sugarboo, I'm levitating,
The Milky Way, we're renegading.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight.
I need you all night, come on, dance with me.
I'm levitating,
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (.
You're the,
moonlight,
I need you all night, come on, dance with me.
I'm levitating,
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy.
I see us written in the stars.
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never!
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far!
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes.
Shining just the way we are.
I feel like we're forever every time we get together!
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars,

We haven't talked all morning.
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall.
I'm scared, I'm falling,
Losing all, losing all my control.
And I'm tired of talking,
Feel myself saying the same old things.
But this love's important,
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way?

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.
Feel like we about to break up.
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time.
Touch me like you touch nobody!
Put your hands all up on me.
Tired of hearing sorry,
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up.
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me.
Tired of hearing sorry,
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up.
Kiss, kiss and make up.
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up.
Kiss, kiss and make up.
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up.

Listen, little lady,
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday.
You work late, you was with a perv makin' dirty fake love in his Mercedes.
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night.
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try.
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night,
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry.
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for.
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw.
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure.
They'll know you're fibbin' if you tell them you got hit by a door.
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothin' but a dumb hooker,
Medical attention could be fatal 'cause the cunt wouldn't.
Ever let a doctor near someone that's gettin' dough for him.
Cause next you got poxy authorities stickin' their noses in.
She's just under the upper hand.
And goes mad for a couple grams,
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight,
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland.
And sell love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
For angels to fly,

White lips, pale face,
Breathin' in the snowflakes,
Burnt lungs, sour taste,
Light's gone, days end,
Struggling to pay rent,
Long nights, strange men,
And they say,
She's in the Class A Team.
Stuck in her daydream,
Been this way since eighteen.
but lately,
Her face seems,
Slowly sinking, wasting,
Crumbling like pastries,
And they scream,
"The worst things in life come free to us".
'Cause we're just under the upper hand.
And go mad for a couple grams,
And she don't wanna go outside tonight,
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland,
Or sells love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
Angels to fly,

I don't want bruise your ears.
Or hurt you again,
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab,
When I needed a friend?
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound!
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd.
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now.
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud.
And I can't, no, I won't hush,
I'll say the words that make you blush.
I'm gonna sing this now.
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is.
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists.
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous.
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures!
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me.
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy.
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free.
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me.
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you.
You need me, man, I don't need you.
You need me, man, I don't need you at all.
You need me, man, I don't need you.
You need me, man, I don't need you.
You need me, man, I don't need you.
You need me, man, I don't need you at all.
You need me.

It's late in the evenin', glass on the side.
I've been sat with you for most of the night.
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear.
So maybe we could get down now,
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program.
I want you to be mine, lady.
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land,
And for the longest time, lady,
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone.
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh!
If you love me, come on, get involved.
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe.
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh!
Sing,
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!
Louder,
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!
Sing,
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!

I met this girl late last year.
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear".
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake".
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait.
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned,
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn.
But I gave her my time for two or three nights,
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right.
I went away for months until our paths crossed again.
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend!
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10.
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin!
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM".
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'!
Don't **** with my love?
That heart is so cold.
All over my home,
I don't wanna know that, babe.
Don't **** with my love?
I told her, she knows.
Take aim and reload,
I don't wanna know that, babe.

The message resonated with fans, and it….
When your legs don't work like they used to before?
And I can't sweep you off of your feet,
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy,
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three,
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how,
People fall in love in mysterious ways.
Maybe just the touch of a hand.
And I just wanna tell you I am,
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms,
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars.
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud,
Maybe we found love right where we are.
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades?
And the crowds don't remember my name,
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm?
I know you will still love me the same.
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen!
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory!

Na-na-na-na,
Mmm,
I've been spinnin' now for time.
Couple women by my side.
I got sinnin' on my mind.
Sippin' on red wine,
I've been sittin' here for ages.
Rippin' out the pages,
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now!
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes.
One or two could free my mind.
This is how it ends.
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream.
Fading out again,
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream.
So tell me when it kicks in,

When I was six years old, I broke my leg,
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends.
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down,
I was younger then, take me back to when I.
Found my heart and broke it here.
Made friends and lost them through the years.
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown,
But I can't wait to go home,
I'm on my way,
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes.
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer",
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real,
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill.
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes.
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends.
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right?
But I was younger then, take me back to when,
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid.
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight.
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown.
But I can't wait to go home,

A club isn't the best place to find a lover.
So the bar is where I go,
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots.
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow.
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me,
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now,
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox.
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like,
Girl, you know I want your love.
Your love was handmade for somebody like me!
Well, come on now, follow my lead.
I may be crazy, don't mind me.
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much".
Grab on my waist and put that body on me.
Well, come on now, follow my lead.
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm!
I'm in love with the shape of you.
We push and pull like a magnet do.
Although my heart is fallin' too.
I'm in love with your body.
And last night, you were in my room,
And now my bed sheets smell like you,
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new.
Well, I'm in love with your body.

Ooh, ooh,
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no.
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control.
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes.
And tonight had something wonderful,
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone.
Conversations with a stranger I barely know.
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't.
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do.
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space.
And I know I lose control of the things that I say,
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape!
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true!
My bad habits lead to you.
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,
My bad habits lead to you.
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,
My bad habits lеad to you.

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours.
So I could just show up and bring the news,
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her.
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you.
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine.
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day,
So much has changed since you've been away,
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours.
So I could just swing by and ask your advice,
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them.
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right?
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure.
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create".
So much has changed since you've been away,
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours.
And I would ask them if I could take you home,
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best,
So I will live life the way you taught me,
And make it on my own,

I took an arrow to the heart.
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours!
Strawberries and then somethin' more.
Ooh, yeah, I want it all.
Lipstick on my guitar,
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far.
Go dancin' underneath the stars!
Ooh, yeah, I want it all.
Mmm, you got me feelin' like.
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes.
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm.
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night.
Yeah, you got me singin' like!
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that.
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers,
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks!
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back,
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that",
And when you're close up, give me the shivers,
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks!
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back,

This is a dark parade.
Another rough patch to rain on.
To rain on,
I know your friends may say.
This is a cause for celebration.
Hip, hip, hooray, love,
Photographs in sepia tones,
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold,
Alone,
There are times when I can feel your ghost.
Just when I'm almost letting you go.
The cards were stacked against us both.
I will always love you for what it's worth!
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass!
And I know time may change the way you think of us,
But I'll remember the way we were,
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave!
Baby, you will never be lost on me!
This is a goddamn shame.
I never wanted to break it!
Leave us tainted,
Know I should walk away.
But I just can't replace us,
Or even erase us,

Build the fire and gather 'round the tree.
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me.

So kiss me under the mistletoe,
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow.
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go.
Next year, you never know!
But for now, Merry Christmas,
We'll,
dance in the kitchen,
while embers glow,
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all.
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know.
My God, you look bеautiful.
Right now, Merry Christmas,

The fire is raging on.
And we'll all sing along to the song,
Just having so much fun.
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone!

I met her smokin' a cigarette in a toilet cubicle.
Red  dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful.
This  ain't the time or place to start a future, but, darlin', I don't care.
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere!
Well, darlin', here we go again.
We  are only man and woman and we all make mistakes.
"Don't  you know we're only human?", is what I heard you say.
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain,
'Cause  I have felt the same, no.
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice!
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try.
And I see a hope that's in her eyes,
Oh,  can you see the love in mine?
She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine.
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined.
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go,
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls.
Well, darlin', here we go again.
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts!
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are.
And I could put you back together when you come apart,
And we should make a start now, oh,

It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives.
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine.
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life.
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two?
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you,
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do.
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth,
Why am I feelin' so nervous when?
Things are goin' so perfect? And.
But I know that it's worth it to,
Spend forever with you!
And so I count to three and get on one knee,
And I ask you,
Darlin', honestly,
I've waited all this time just to make it right.
So I'll ask you,
Will you marry me? Just say yes?
One word, one love, one life.
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair.
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware.
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes.
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives?
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red.
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed.
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth.
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you,

I will remember you.
In the way you'd want me to,
But it's hard to come to terms right now,
Sunset looked today,
As if it knew you'd gone away.
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down!
Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain!
Oh, I could be a shoulder, not a burden!
And it's time for me to call your son again,
And say,
She was the starlight in darkness.
She was the first bloom in spring.
An angel with a smile like electric light.
All the time, hit her wings.
She was the birdsong in morning.
But now everything here has changed!
All the world's less beautiful.
Since you've been away,
I will remember you.
With white wine by the barbecue,
On New York at the birthday do, downtown,
All that comes to mind.
When I think about the time?
Is a memory of laughin' out loud?

Welcome to the world,
I heard your heart beat and lost every word.
Just stood there quietly taking in the sound.
Of our love,
This is gonna hurt,
But I'll stand beside you, for better or for worse,
And I will find you whenever you're lost!
I'll be right here,
And ooh, I know that everything's changin'!
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing.
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same.
And this love won't ever go away,
Welcome to the world,
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt,
Don't let them change you, words are only words?
Just like I loved you.
And yes, you were the first,
A new beginning, bright and unreserved.
A beautiful red flower in the earth.
Will grow, and I know?

I know it's a bad idea.
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year.
And I thought a few drinks, they might help.
It's been a while, my dear.
Dealin' with the cards life dealt.
I'm still holdin' back these tears.
While my friends are somewhere else!
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February.
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat.
'Cause I'm here alonе,
Just dancin' with my eyes closed.
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you!
And time is movin' so slow,
And I don't know what else that I can do,
So I'll keep dancin' with my,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed,
Eye-eye-eye-eyes,
So I'll keep dancin' with my,

Came in for the embers.
Stayed out for the breeze.
I need to feel elements to remind me.
There's beauty when it's bleak.
Stuck out long before lights down.
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know?
The more that I love, the less that I feel.
The times that I jumped never were real!
They say that all scars will heal, but I know.
Maybe I won't,
But the waves won't break my boat,
But the waves won't brеak my boat,
The stones crash on the boardwalk.
Thе wind rush through the trees.
I keep my eyes peeled.
The memories always fall short!
Of what we could've been,
Left out long before last call.
What do I need? Oh, I know?

He explained his motivation for….
I found a love for me.
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead!
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet.
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me!
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love.
Not knowin' what it was!
I will not give you up this time.
But, darlin', just kiss me slow.
Your heart is all I own.
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine,
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms!
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song.
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath?
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight",
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know.
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home.
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets.
To carry love, to carry children of our own,

The song…,
Lovin' can hurt,
Lovin' can hurt sometimes,
But it's the only thing that I know,
And when it gets hard,
You know it can get hard sometimes.
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.
We keep this love in a photograph.
We made these memories for ourselves.
Where our eyes are never closin'?
Hearts are never broken!
And time's forever frozen still!
So you can keep me,
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet.
You won't ever be alone.
Wait for me to come home.
Lovin' can heal,
Lovin' can mend your soul.
And it's the only thing that I know, know,
I swear it will get easier.
Remember that with every piece of ya.
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die.

Ed Sheeran…,
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill.
I threw the day-old tea from the cup.
Memories of a life that's been loved.
Took the get-well-soon cards and stuffed animals.
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink.
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"!
But, Mum, there's a tear every time that I blink.
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know!
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved.
So I'll sing Hallelujah,
You were an angel in the shape of my mum.
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up?
Spread your wings as you go.
When God takes you back?
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home".
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up.
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case.
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek.
And wiped a tear from the side of my face,

Walkin' down 29th and Park.
I saw you in another's arm.
Only a month we've been apart.
You look happier.
Saw you walk inside a bar.
He said somethin' to make you laugh.
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours.
Yeah, you look happier, you do!
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you!
But ain't nobody love you like I do!
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby.
If you're movin' on with someone new.
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do.
My friends told me one day I'll feel it, too.
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth,
But I know I was happier with you,
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah,
Sat in the corner of the room.
Everything's reminding me of you!
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself.
You're happier, aren't you?

I found a love for me.
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead!
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet.
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me!
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love.
Not knowin' what it was!
I will not give you up this time.
But, darling, just kiss me slow.
Your heart is all I own.
And in your eyes, you're holding mine,
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms!
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song.
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath?
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight,
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know.
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home.
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets.
To carry love, to carry children of our own,

She played the fiddle in an Irish band.
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand.
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance".
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar.
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar.
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun.
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun.
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar.
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance.
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band.
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand.
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance".
With my pretty little Galway Girl,
You're my pretty little Galway Girl.
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool.
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room!
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool.
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes,
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet!
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat.
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week!
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me,

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys.
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys.
You left a blood stain on the floor.
You set your sights on him.
You left a handprint on the door.
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before.
This is our luck, baby, running out.
Our clothes were never off!
We still have our roads to run about.
I've seen you in a fight you lost.
I've seen you in a fight.
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me.
In our house made of paper, your words all over me,
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me.
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys.
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys.

It’s about letting go. As opposed to all the….
Oh, oh, starry-eyed!
Hip, oh, sta-a-a-a—,
Oh, oh, deye-yrrats!
​swolg ydobyrevE, starry-eyed,
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning.
Handlebars that I let go, let go for anyone.
Take me in and I'll throw out my heart and get a new one.
Next thing, we're touching,
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning, ah.
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed!
And everybody glows,
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed!
And my body goes,
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah.
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah.
Woah, oh, oh,
So we burst into colours, colours and carousels,
Fall head first like paper planes and playground games.

I had a way then.
Losing it all on my own.
I had a heart then.
But the queen has been overthrown,
And I'm not sleeping now,
The dark is too hard to beat.
And I'm not keeping now,
The strength I need to push me.
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone.
You shine it when I'm alone.
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong,
And dreaming when they're gone,
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home.
Calling, calling, calling home,
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone.
You shine it when I'm alone.
Noises!
I play within my head.
Touch my own skin,
And hope that I'm still breathin',
And I think back to when,
My brother and my sister slept.
In an unlocked place,
The only time I feel safe.

It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside.
I'm not one of those who can easily hide.
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did.
I'd buy a big house where we both could live.
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do,
See, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue.
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean.
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen.
And you can tell everybody,
This is your song,
It may be quite simple, but.
Now that it's done!
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind.
That I put down in words.
How wonderful life is?
Now you're in the world!
If I was a sculptor, but, then again, no.
Or a girl who makes potions in a travelling show,
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do.
My gift is my song and this one's for you.

Stripped to the waist, we fall into the river.
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret.
I've been trying to hide.
We held our breath to see our names are written.
On the wreck of '86,
That was the year I knew the panic was over.
Yes, since we found out, since we found out!
That anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could,
After the war, we said we'd fight together,
I guess we thought that's just what humans do.
Letting darkness grow!
As if we need its palette and we need its colour.
But now I've seen it through and now I know the truth,
That anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could happen, anything could happen.
Anything could,

We don't have to worry 'bout nothing!
'Cause we got the fire.
And we're burning one hell of a something,
They,
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space.
Light it up,
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race.
When the lights turned down?
They don't know what they heard.
Strike the match, play it loud.
Giving love to the world.
We'll be raising our hands.
Shinin' up to the sky.
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire.
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire!
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn,
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn.
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn!
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn.

We were lovers for the first time.
Running all the red lights.
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah.
We were sipping on emotions.
Smoking and inhaling every moment.
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah.
We were high and we were sober.
We were on and we were over.
We were young and now I'm older.
But I'd do it all again,
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes.
Ten dollars was a fat stack.
I'd do it all again.
Bomber jacket and a snapback.
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach.
"Re: Stacks" on the playback.
I'd do it all again.
We were lovers on a wild ride.
Speeding for the finish line.
Come until the end of our time, yeah!
Started off as a wildfire.
Burning down the bridges to our empire.
Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah.

You're the light, you're the night.
You're the colour of my blood.
You're the cure, you're the pain.
You're the only thing I wanna touch.
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much!
You're the fear, I don't care.
'Cause I've never been so high!
Follow me through the dark.
Let me take you past the satellites!
You can see the world you brought to life, to life.
So love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do,
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do!
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do.
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out,
On the edge of paradise,
Every inch of your skin.
Is a holy grail I've gotta find?
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah.

Oh, oh, oh, oh!
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started.
I don't even really know what you intended.
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous.
Poured it down, so I poured it down.
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you.
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you.
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos.
Poured it down, so I poured it down.
And now I don't understand it,
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth.
And I know I shouldn't say it,
But my heart don't understand,
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?
But my heart don't understand,
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?
Why I got you on my mind?

Even though we both know we're liars.
And we start each other's fires,
We just know that we'll be alright.
Even though we're kicked out the party.
'Cause we both hate everybody.
We're the ones they wanna be like.
So don't let me down,
Keep me in trouble,
Born to be wild,
Out in the jungle,

And I don't wanna be somebody without your body!
Close to me,
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody!
Close to me (,
Yeah, yeah!
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like.
Animal like you,
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body!
Close to me (,
Woo,
You can never come too close for comfort!
I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn.
I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover.
And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber,
Iced out body, didn't go to college.
Price tag poppin', then you on a private.
Don't say sorry, everyone's watchin'?
When you're where I am, everything's timeless?

Remember me in a simple way, not what I did or said.
When I think of you now, I just think of the day we met?
Don't forget me, like I didn't care?
Yeah, I stole from myself just to make you complete!
I don't think you have the patience.
I don't think you know the difference.
And I don't want cute imitations,
I know you wanted to save me.
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you,
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough.
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you,
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on.
Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know, I wanna know.
When the memories pack up and leave, it will set me free?
All those days on the beach will be washing away from me.
I will keep you secretly just to keep the peace.
Keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas.

Do you remember when we moved out?
My mum said, "I love you, but it's a small house".
So we changed up and saved up,
Gave up our town,
We were dangerous, couldn't tame us.
What's missing now?
Time (,
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
Suddenly, we got no time (.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
We're so busy doing life (.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine.
If you just focus on me.
Like we were sixteen,
And plotting our lives,
Can I wear your t-shirt and sleep?
On you while I dream,
Of all the good times?
When we were sixteen?
Like we were sixteen,
Like we were sixteen,

You can worry 'bout this.
You can worry 'bout that.
You can worry 'bout she.
You can worry 'bout this.
You can worry 'bout that.
You can worry 'bout she.
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me!
Lately, I don't think, I don't think about you, feelin' so free.
Been jumpin' through hoops to get under you, but now I'm cool.
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me!
Been havin' good times,
Been havin' late nights, yeah.
And then you call me,
Ask if I'm alright, what the hell?
Sayin' that you care about me.
But you just wanna be in my head 'cause you're lonely,
I thought I needed you to feel safe.
But now that I've been through it, I'm stuck in a good place,
Ooh, why you tryna put me in a different mood?
Just because I'm still not seein' someone new?

Painted to pure perfection,
We had a real connection.
Bodies aching, overtaken,
You kept me at a distance.
Not asking any questions!
Fingers pressing, learning lessons,
Beautiful lies on a Friday night.
Starting to wonder where we lost the magic.
Head in the clouds, talking so loud, all I hear is static.
I'm not a material girl.
Everything in your world just feels like plastic!
Wearing your crown, it's pulling me down.
You just want the power.
You're not really down for love.
You just want the power.
No, I'm not chasing paper!
And I'm not faking neither,
Take me higher or this will expire.
Your self obsessions boring,
Sorry if I'm ignoring,
Mindless actions lead to destruction.

Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me.
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me.
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me!
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me.
I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed.
I bet you're still walkin' on a tightrope.
Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho.
You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know.
It's a thin line between all this love and hate.
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place,
So, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate.
Yeah, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate!
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me,
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me.
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me!
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me.
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me.
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me.
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me!
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me.

Fire and ice,
This love is like fire and ice.
This love is like rain and blue skies.
This love is like sun on the rise.
This love got me rolling the dice.
Don't let me lose?
Still falling for you,
Still falling for you,
Beautiful mind,
Your heart got a story with mine.
Your heart got me hurting at times.
Your heart gave me new kind of highs.
Your heart got me feeling so fine.
So what to do,
Still falling for you,
Still falling for you,
It took us a while.
With every breath a new day,
With love on the line,
We've had our share of mistakes.
But all your flaws and scars are mine,
Still falling for you,
Still falling for you,

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times.
Welcome to the final show.
I hope you're wearing your best clothes.
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky.
You look pretty good down here.
But you ain't really good,
If we never learn we've been here before!
Why are we always stuck and running from?
The bullets, the bullet?
We never learn, we've been here before!
Why are we always stuck and running from?
Your bullets, a bullet?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times.
We gotta get away from here.
We gotta get away from here.
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright.
They told me that the end is near.
We gotta get away from here.
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life.
Breaking through the atmosphere,
Things look pretty good from here.
Remember everything will be alright!
We can meet again somewhere!
Somewhere far away from here!

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way.
Never coming back down!
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay.
Wouldn't put it like that?
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way.
Never coming around!
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same.
La-da-da-da-da,
All the lights couldn't put out the dark.
Runnin' through my heart,
Lights up and they know who you are.
Know who you are,
Do you know who you are?
Shine, step into the light.
Shine, so bright sometimes,
Shine, I'm not ever going back.
Shine, step into the light.
Shine, so bright sometimes,
Shine, I'm not ever going back.
Shine, step into the light.
Shine, so bright sometimes,
Shine, I'm not ever,

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'.
And it sounds just like a song,
I want more berries and that summer feelin'.
It's so wonderful and warm.
Breathe me in, breathe me out.
I don't know if I could ever go without.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I don't know if I could ever go without.
Watermelon sugar high,
Watermelon sugar high,
Watermelon sugar high,
Watermelon sugar high,
Watermelon sugar,
Strawberries on a summer evenin'.
Baby, you're the end of June!
I want your belly and that summer feelin'.
Getting washed away in you!
Breathe me in, breathe me out.
I don't know if I could ever go without.

Walk in your rainbow paradise.
Strawberry lipstick state of mind.
I get so lost inside your eyes.
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me.
You don't have to say nothing!
You don't have to say you're mine.
Honey!
I'd walk through fire for you.
Just let me adore you.
Oh, honey!
I'd walk through fire for you.
Just let me adore you.
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do.
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do.
Your wonder under summer skies.
Brown skin and lemon over ice.
Would you believe it?

Holdin' me back,
Gravity's holdin' me back,
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand.
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say!
When everything gets in the way?
Seems you cannot be replaced.
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh,
In this world, it's just us,
You know it's not the same as it was.
In this world, it's just us,
You know it's not the same as it was.
As it was, as it was.
You know it's not the same.
Answer the phone,
"Harry, you're no good alone.
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"?
Ringin' the bell,
And nobody's coming to help!
Your daddy lives by himself.
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh.

I had started to feel myself becoming someone I didn’t want to be, and that was really hard.
Harry brings his agony to life….
I'm in my bed,
And you're not here,
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands,
Forget what I said,
It's not what I meant.
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left,
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'.
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'.
You said you cared, and you missed me too.
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you,
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe,
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say,
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'.
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'.

Put a price on emotion.
I'm looking for something to buy.
You've got my devotion,
But man, I can hate you sometimes,
I don't want to fight you.
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt,
We'll get the drinks in.
So I'll get to thinking of her,
We'll be a fine line.
We'll be a fine line.
We'll be a fine line.
We'll be a fine line.
We'll be a fine line.
We'll be a fine line.
Test of my patience,
There's things that we'll never know!
You sunshine, you temptress.
My hand's at risk, I fold.
Crisp trepidation,
I'll try to shake this soon.
Spreading you open,
Is the only way of knowing you?
Ooh, ooh,

“Matilda” is the seventh track off Harry’s House, the third studio album by Harry Styles.
You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal".
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels,
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now!
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal,
You can let it go.
You can throw a party full of everyone you know!
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love!
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm.
Matilda,
, you talk of the pain like it's all alright.
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе,
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days.
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind.
You can let it go.
You can throw a party full of everyone you know!
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love!
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up.
You can see the world, following the seasons.
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason!
'Cause they never showed you love!
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own.

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes.
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect.
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it,
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck.
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it.
But I'm into it , I'm kinda into it,
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it.
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said.
"I'm having your baby",
"It's none of your business".
"I'm having your baby",
"It's none of your business".
"I'm having your baby",
"It's none of your business".
"I'm having your baby",
"It's none of your, it's none of your—".
It's New York, baby, always jacked up!
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up!
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus?
In a black dress,
she's such an actress,

Here to take my medicine, take my medicine.
Treat you like a gentleman.
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline.
Think I'm gonna stick with it.
I'm here to take my medicine, take my medicine.
Rest it on my fingertips.
And up to your mouth, I'm feelin' it out,
I'm feelin' it now,
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted.
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you t—,
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive.
You got that something, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it.
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh.
La-la-la-la-da,
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh.
La-la-la-la-da,
Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes.
Tingle running through my bones.
The boys and the girls are in.
I mess around with him.
And I'm okay with it,

Coucou,
Don't you call him "baby"?
We're not talkin' lately,
Don't you call him what you used to call me?
I, I confess,
I can tell that you are at your best.
I'm selfish so I'm hating it.
I noticed that.
There's a piece of you in how I dress.
Take it as a compliment.
Don't you call him "baby"?
We're not talkin' lately,
Don't you call him what you used to call me?
I, I just miss,
I just miss your accent and your friends.
Did you know I still talk to them?

Justin dedicated the music…,
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror.
And I can't help but notice,
You reflect in this heart of mine.
If you ever feel alone and.
The glare makes me hard to find.
Just know that I'm always!
Parallel on the other side.
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul.
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go.
Just put your hand on the glass.
I'll be tryna pull you through.
You just gotta be strong.
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now.
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me.
The vacancy that sat in my heart.
Is a space that now you hold?
Show me how to fight for now.
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy,
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out.
You were right here all along.
It's like you're my mirror.
My mirror's staring back at me.
I couldn't get any bigger.
With anyone else beside me,
And now it's clear as this promise,
That we're making,
Two reflections into one,
'Cause it's like you're my mirror.
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me.
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled.
And I can't help but stare, 'cause,
I see truth somewhere in your eyes!
Ooh, I can't ever change without you.
You reflect me, I love that about you.
And if I could, I,
Would look at us all the time?
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul.
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go.
Just put your hand on the glass.
I'm here tryna pull you through.
You just gotta be strong.

[Intro: Justin Timberlake &,
Timbaland,
Ooh-oh,
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit tied.
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit.
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby, 'cause.

I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'.
Hey, going hot, so hot, just like an oven.
And ow! Burned myself, I just had to touch it,
But it's so fire, and it's all mine,
Hey, baby, and we don't mind all the watchin', ha.
'Cause if they study close, real close.
They might learn somethin'.
She ain't nothin' but a little doozy when she does it.
She's so fire tonight,
And as long as I got my suit and tie,
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight.
And you got fixed up to the nines,
Let me show you a few things!
All pressed up in black and white.
And you're dressed in that dress I like,
Love is swingin' in the air tonight!
Let me show you a few things!

Now we're in the swing of love!

Ooh,
[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake,
Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton.
Everyone knows!
all about my direction,
And in my heart somewhere!
I wanna go there.
Still, I don't go there.
Everybody says, "Say somethin'",
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'".
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'".
Then, "Say somethin'",
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it.
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no,
Caught up in the middle of it.
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no!
Caught up in the rhythm of it.
[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake &,
Chris Stapleton,
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have.
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have.
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have.

I'm bringin' sexy back,
Yeah!
Them other boys don't know how to act,
Yeah!
I think it's special, what's behind your back?
Yeah!
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack,
Yeah!
Take it to the bridge.
c'mon,
[Bridge: Justin Timberlake &,
Timbaland,
Dirty babe,
Uh-huh,
You see these shackles, baby, I'm your slave,
Uh-huh,
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave,
Uh-huh,
It's just that no one makes me feel this way,
Uh-huh,
Take it to the chorus.
[Chorus: Timbaland &,
Justin Timberlake,
Come here, girl!
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Come to the back!
Go 'head, be gone with it!
VIP,
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Drinks on me,
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Let me see what you're twerkin' with!

Get your sexy on!
Go 'head, be gone with it!
Get your sexy on!

I got this feelin' inside my bones.
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on.
All through my city, all through my home.
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone.
I got that sunshine in my pocket.
, got that good soul in my feet.
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops.
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally.
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop.
And under the lights when everything goes!
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close!
When we move, well, you already know?
So just imagine,
Nothin' I can see but you!
When you dance, dance, dance?
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you.
So just dance, dance, dance, come on,
All those things I shouldn't do.
But you dance, dance, dance,
And ain't nobody leavin' soon!
So keep dancin',

Gaga…,
Tell me somethin', girl,
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
I'm fallin',
In all the good times, I find myself longin',
For change,
And, in the bad times, I fear myself.
Tell me something, boy,
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?
I'm falling,
In all the good times, I find myself longing,
For change,
And, in the bad times, I fear myself.
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in.
I'll never meet the ground!
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us.
We're far from the shallow now.

I, I just woke up from a dream.
Where you and I had to say goodbye?
And I don't know what it all means,
But since I survived, I realized,
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow?
Nobody's promised tomorrow!
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night,
Like it's the last night.
If the world was ending.
I'd wanna be next to you.
If the party was over.
And our time on Earth was through,
I'd wanna hold you just for a while.
And die with a smile,
If the world was ending.
I'd wanna be next to you.

Mum-mum-mum-mah,
Mum-mum-mum-mah,
Mum-mum-mum-mah,
Mum-mum-mum-mah,
Mum-mum-mum-mah,
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please.
Fold 'em,
let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me!
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start!
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart,
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got.
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got.
Can't read my, can't read my?
No, he can't read my poker face!
Can't read my, can't read my?
No, he can't read my poker face!

Gaga talked to Grazia about writing this record saying:
I was in Russia, then Germany, and….
Oh, caught in a bad romance!
Oh, caught in a bad romance!
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah,
Roma, roma-ma,
Gaga, ooh, la, la,
Want your bad romance,
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah,
Roma, roma-ma,
Gaga, ooh, la, la,
Want your bad romance,
I want your ugly, I want your disease.
I want your everything as long as it's free!
I want your love.
Love, love, love, I want your love, ayy!
I want your drama, the touch of your hand (.
Hey,
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand.
I want your love.
Love, love, love, I want your love!
You know that I want you.
And you know that I need you,
I want it bad, your bad romance.

Gaga played a short snippet of….
Abracadabra, abracadabra,
Abracadabra, abracadabra,
Pay the toll to the angels.
Drawing circles in the clouds.
Keep your mind on the distance.
When the devil turns around?
Hold me in your heart tonight.
In the magic of the dark moonlight,
Save me from this empty fight.
In the game of life,
Like a poem said by a lady in red.
You hear the last few words of your life.
With a haunting dance,
now you're both in a trance!
It's time to cast your spell on the night.
"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na,
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga,
Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na",
In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight",

It doesn't matter if you love him.
Or capital "H-I-M",
M, M, M, M,
Just put your paws up.
'Cause you were born this way, baby.
My mama told me when I was young.
"We are all born superstars".
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on.
In the glass of her boudoir,
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"!
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe".
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far,
Listen to me when I say.
I'm beautiful in my way.
'Cause God makes no mistakes.
I was born this way.
Don't hide yourself in regret?
Just love yourself and you're set.
I was born this way.

‘Always Remember Us This Way’ is the 8th song featured on the A Star is Born Soundtrack!
That Arizona sky,
Burnin' in your eyes,
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire.
It's buried in my soul.
Like California gold,
You found the light in me that I couldn't find.
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words,
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts.
When the sun goes down?
And the band won't play,
I'll always remember us this way!
Lovers in the night!
Poets tryna write,
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try.
But all I really know,
You're where I wanna go.
The part of me that's you will never die!
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words,
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts.
When the sun goes down?
And the band won't play,
I'll always remember us this way!

The song is about a few different things–it’s about….
We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out.
Got my flash on, it's true!
Need that picture of you, it's so magical.
We'd be so fantastico,
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous.
Not sure what it means!
But this photo of us, it don't have a price,
Ready for those,
flashing lights,
'Cause you know that, baby, I.
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me.
Papa-paparazzi,
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be!
Your papa-paparazzi,
Promise I'll be kind,
But I won't stop until that boy is mine,
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me!
Papa-paparazzi,
I'll be your girl backstage at your show.
Velvet ropes and guitars,
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets!
Eyeliner and cigarettes,
Shadow is burnt,
, yellow, dance and we turn.
My lashes are dry,
Purple teardrops I cry,
, it don't have a price.
Loving you is cherry pie.
'Cause you know that, baby, I.

Considering…,
Yeah!
Turn the mic up,
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh.
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh.
I, I feel good, I walk alone.
But then I trip over myself and I fall,
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay.
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream,
So do what you want, what you want with my body,
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party?
Do what you want, what you want with my body?
Do what you want, what you want with my body?
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me.
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry.
Do what you want, what you want with my body?
What you want with my body?
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind.
But do what you want with my body,
Do what you want with my body?
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life.
But do what you want with my body,
Do what you want with my body?

I found a guy, told me I was a star.
He held the door, held my hand in the dark.
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face.
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
And there's one more boy, he's from my past,
We fell in love, but it didn't last.
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away.
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway,
All I want is love that lasts.
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy.
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day.
But shouldn't that be enough for me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,
And I miss the days when I was young and naive,
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me.
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily!

I got my driver's license last week.
Just like we always talked about!
'Cause you were so excited for me.
To finally drive up to your house,
But today, I drove through the suburbs,
Crying 'cause you weren't around.
And you're probably with that blonde girl,
Who always made me doubt!
She's so much older than me.
She's everything I'm insecure about!
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs!
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one!
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone,
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me.
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street!
And all my friends are tired,
Of hearing how much I miss you, but,
I kinda feel sorry for them.
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do!
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs!
And pictured I was driving home to you,

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily.
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks.
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself,
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped.
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl!
Well, good for you,
You look happy and healthy, not me.
If you ever cared to ask.
Good for you!
You're doin' great out there without me, baby.
God, I wish that I could do that!
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night.
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom.
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it,
But I guess good for you,
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want!
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off.
It's like we never even happened!
Baby, what the fuck is up with that?
And good for you, it's like you never even met me!
Remember when you swore to God I was the only.
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you.
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do!

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now.
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted,
Look at you, cool guy, you got it.
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes.
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise.
I loved you truly.
You gotta laugh at the stupidity.
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes.
But you make the worst one look fine,
I should've known it was strange.
You only come out at night.
I used to think I was smart.
But you made me look so naive,
The way you sold me for parts.
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh.
Bloodsucker, fame fucker,
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire.
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news,
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too.
You're so convincing,
How do you lie without flinching?
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill!
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will?
Went for me and not her.
'Cause girls your age know better.

Car rides to Malibu,
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two.
And tradin' jackets,
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you.
Watching reruns of,
Glee,
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony.
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm.
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused.
That was our place, I found it first.
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you.
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu?  Hmm?
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same.
Another actress,
I hate to think that I was just your type.
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel,
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl".
You're singin' it together,
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her!
In between the chorus and the verse,

We broke up a month ago.
Your friends are mine, you know I know.
You've moved on, found someone new.
One more girl who brings out the better in you.
And I thought my heart was detached,
From all the sunlight of our past,
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty,
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy!
But not like how you were with me,
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go.
So find someone great, but don't find no one better,
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier.
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean!
Remember when I believed,
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart,
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart.
But she's beautiful, she looks kind,
She probably gives you butterflies.

Ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah.
I played dumb, but I always knew!
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse.
I kept quiet so I could keep you.
And ain't it funny how you ran to her,
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it!
You betrayed me.
And I know that you'll never feel sorry!
For the way I hurt, yeah,
You talked to her when we were together.
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter!
It took you two weeks to go off and date her.
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor.
Now you bring her around just to shut me down!
Show her off like she's a new trophy.
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you,
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly?

I have nightmares each week 'bout that Friday in May.
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed.
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers.
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers!
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did,
But I hold onto every detail like my life depends on it,
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge.
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough,
And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream,
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine,
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long,
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong.
The arguments that I've won against you in my head.
In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed,
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone, and I make you feel so guilty!
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry,
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me,
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy.
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people,
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal!

“lacy,” the fourth track of GUTS, sees Olivia blur the line between envy and homoeroticism.
In one lens, Rodrigo embraces her inferiority complex by personifying the beauty of women she’s intimidated by in…,
Lacy, oh Lacy, skin like puff pastry.
Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell?
Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies.
Did I ever tell you that I’m not doin' well?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care.
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time.
Watching, hidden in plain sight.
And ooh, I try, I try, I try,
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere!
The sweetest torture one could bear.
Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin’ it lately.
I feel your compliments likе bullets on skin.
Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnatе,
Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care.
Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots.
You got the one thing that I want.
Ooh, I try, I try, I try.
Try to rationalize, people are people.
But it's like you're made of angel dust,

One, two, three,
Wait, is this the song with the drums?
I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring.
He argued with me about everything!
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye.
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, "Dude, nice try".
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends,
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end!
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance.
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе,
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed,
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend.
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down?
If I had to choose, I would say right now.
I wanna get him back.
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad.
Oh, I wanna get him back!
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad.
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again!
I want to get him back, back, back.

Double OT?

Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you.

Act a fool on stage.
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car.

Threw a TV out the window of the Montage.
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn.
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in.
Sayin', "I'm with the band".

But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yeah!
Everyone countin' on me drop the ball, yeah!
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah!
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky.
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side.
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eye.

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael!
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you?
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload.

Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked.

And I can't ever tell you no,

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy,

Needless to say, I'm keeping a check.
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless!
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck.
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck.
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip.
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip.
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt.
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt.
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse.
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose.
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya.
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much.
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya,
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower.

Ooh,
I fall apart.
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah,
She told me that I'm not enough.
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah,
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault.
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred.
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain!
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah,
Ooh, I fall apart,
Down to my core?
Ooh, I fall apart,
Down to my core?
Ooh,
didn't know it before?
Surprised when you caught me off guard.
All this damn jewelry I bought.
You was my shorty, I thought.
Never caught a feelin' this hard!
Harder than the liquor I pour.
Tell me you don't want me no more.
But I can't let go, everybody told me so,
Feelin' like I sold my soul.
Devil in the form of a whore.
Devil in the form of a whore.
You said it, no, you said it.
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh!

Oh, oh, oh!
Oh,  oh, oh!
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh!
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down.
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud.
I  couldn't be there even when I tried.
You  don't believe it, we do this every time.
Seasons change and our love went cold.
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go.
Run away, but we're running in circles.
Run away, run away,
I dare you to do something.
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame.
Run away, but we're running in circles.
Run away, run away, run away.
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go!
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go.
You thought that it was special, special.
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though,
And I still hear the echoes,
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go.

You probably think that you are better now, better now.
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around.
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down!
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything?
You know I say that I am better now, better now.
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around.
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down!
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything?
Oh woah!
I did not believe that it would end, no.
Everything came second to the Benzo!
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no.
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though.
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes.
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives.
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside.
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like!
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin',
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas,
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget.
But I can't get this shit outta my head,
You probably think that you are better now, better now.
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around.
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down!
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything?
You know I say that I am better now, better now.
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around.
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down!
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything?
Oh woah!

Said she tired of little money, need a big boy.
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy.
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy!
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah.
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen,
All the housewives pullin’ up.
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy.
You was talkin' shit in the beginning.
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin'.
I know it piss you off to see me winnin'.
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ , yeah.
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me.
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army.
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely!
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow".
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me.
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me!
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely!
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow".
Everywhere I go!
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo.
750 Lambo in the Utah snow.
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah.
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck.
Pull up to the house with some big butts.
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club.
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared?
Before I dropped,
Stoney,
none of y'all really cared!
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid!
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit,
Used to have a lot, but I got more now.
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now.
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down!
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy.

We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts.
I'm standing there,
On a balcony in summer air,
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd.
And say, "Hello",
Little did I know,
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles.
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet",
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said.
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone!
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".
So I sneak out to the garden to see you,
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh.

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset.
She's going off about something that you said.
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do!
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts.
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find.
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you.
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me.
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans.
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself.
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town,
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down.
You say you're fine, I know you better than that.
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

I stay out too late.
Got nothin' in my brain!
That's what people say, mm-mm.
That's what people say, mm-mm.
I go on too many dates.
But I can't make them stay,
At least, that's what people say, mm-mm,
That's what people say, mm-mm.
But I keep cruisin',
Can't stop, won't stop movin'?
It's like I got this music in my mind.
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright".
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play.
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate,
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake!
I shake it off, I shake it off.
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break.
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake,
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake!
I shake it off, I shake it off.

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things.
Magic, madness, heaven, sin,
Saw you there and I thought.
"Oh, my God, look at that face.
You look like my next mistake.
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy!
New money, suit and tie.
I can read you like a magazine.
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly.
And I know you heard about me,
So, hey, let's be friends.
I'm dying to see how this one ends.
Grab your passport and my hand.
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend.
So it's gonna be forever!
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm.
If the high was worth the pain.
Got a long list of ex-lovers!
They'll tell you I'm insane.
'Cause you know I love the players.
And you love the game,
'Cause we're young and we're reckless.
We'll take this way too far.
It'll leave you breathless, mm.
Or with a nasty scar,
Got a long list of ex-lovers!
They'll tell you I'm insane.
But I've got a blank space, baby,
And I'll write your name,

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood.
You know it used to be mad love.
So take a look what you've done,
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey.
Now we got problems!
And I don't think we can solve them,
You made a really deep cut.
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey.
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted.
Did you have to ruin?
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted?
Did you have to hit me?
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe?
And rub it in so deep,
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me.
Oh, it's so sad to!
Think about the good times.
You and I.
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood.
You know it used to be mad love.
So take a look what you've done,
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey.
Now we got problems!
And I don't think we can solve them,
You made a really deep cut.
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey.

I don't like your little games.
Don't like your tilted stage?
The role you made me play.
Of the fool, no, I don't like you,
I don't like your perfect crime.
How you laugh when you lie?
You said the gun was mine.
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you?
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time,
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time!
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined.
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh.
Ooh, look what you made me do.
Look what you made me do.
Look what you just made me do.
Look what you just made me.
Ooh, look what you made me do.
Look what you made me do.
Look what you just made me do.
Look what you just made me do.

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser!
Midnights become my afternoons,
When my depression works the graveyard shift?
all of the people,
I've ghosted stand there in the room.
I should not be left to my own devices.
They come with prices and vices.
I end up in crisis.
I wake up screaming from dreaming.
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving.
'Cause you got tired of my scheming.
It's me, hi,
I'm the problem, it's me.
At teatime, everybody agrees,
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror!
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero!
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby.
And I'm a monster on the hill,
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city.
Pierced through the heart, but never killed!

Vintage tee, brand new phone.
High heels on cobblestones,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing?
Sequin smile, black lipstick,
Sensual politics,
When you are young, they assume you know nothing?
But I knew you,
Dancin' in your Levi's,
Drunk under a streetlight, I.
I knew you.
Hand under my sweatshirt,
Baby, kiss it better, I!
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan,
Under someone's bed,
You put me on and said I was your favorite.
A friend to all is a friend to none.
Chase two girls, lose the one.
When you are young, they assume you know nothing?

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night.
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife.
And if it was an open-shut case,
I never would've known from that look on your face!
Lost in your current like a priceless wine.
The more that you say, the less I know.
Wherever you stray, I follow?
I'm begging for you to take my hand.
Wreck my plans, that's my man.
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind.
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in.
As if you were a mythical thing.
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring.
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win,
The more that you say, the less I know.
Wherever you stray, I follow?
I'm begging for you to take my hand.
Wreck my plans, that's my man.
You know that my train could take you home.
Anywhere else is hollow!
I'm begging for you to take my hand.
Wreck my plans, that's my man.

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold.
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now,
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze!
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place.
And I can picture it after all these days,
And I know it's long gone and,
That magic's not here no more.
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all,
Oh, oh, oh!
'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there.
I remember it all too well.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed.
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.

I remember when we broke up the first time.
We hadn't seen each other in a month.
When you said you needed space?
Then you come around again and say.
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me".
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you".
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
We called it off again last night, but.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you.
We are never, ever, ever getting back together!
We are never, ever, ever getting back together!
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me.
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together!
Like, ever,
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights.
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right,
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind,
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine,

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago.
I was in your sights, you got me alone.
You found me, you found me.
You found me-e-e-e-e.
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that.
And when I fell hard, you took a step back,
Without me, without me,
Without me-e-e-e-e,
And he's long gone when he's next to me,
And I realize the blame is on me,
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
'Til you put me down, oh.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
'Til you put me down, oh.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
And the saddest fear comes creeping in,
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
'Til you put me down, oh.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now,
Flew me to places I'd never been!
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
Trouble, trouble, trouble,
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
Trouble, trouble, trouble,

It feels like a perfect night.
To dress up like hipsters,
And make fun of our exes,
Uh-uh, uh-uh,
It feels like a perfect night.
For breakfast at midnight,
To fall in love with strangers,
Uh-uh, uh-uh,
Yeah!
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time.
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah.
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines.
It's time, oh-oh,
I don't know about you.
But I'm feeling twenty-two,
Everything will be alright if!
You keep me next to you.
You don't know about me.
But I'll bet you want to,
Everything will be alright if!
We just keep dancing like we're.
Twenty-two, twenty-two,

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street.
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly.
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall.
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.
Losing him was blue like I'd never known!
Missing him was dark gray, all alone.
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met!
But loving him was red,
Loving him was red,
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you.
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song.
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer.
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong!
Losing him was blue like I'd never known!
Missing him was dark gray, all alone.
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met!
But loving him was red,

Taylor explained a bit about what the….
There's somethin' 'bout the way.
The street looks when it's just rained.
There's a glow off the pavement.
You walk me to the car.
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there,
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah,
Oh, yeah!
We're driving down the road.
I wonder if you know.
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now.
But you're just so cool,
Run your hands through your hair.
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you.
And I don't know how it gets better than this,
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless.
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance,
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless,
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road.
In this one-horse town,
I wanna stay right here.
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me,
In this moment now, capture it, remember it,

I am not the kind of girl.
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion.
But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marrying the wrong girl.
I sneak in and see your friends.
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room!
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry.
This is surely not what you thought it would be.
I lose myself in a daydream.
Where I stand and say?
Don't say yes, run away now?
I'll meet you when you're out.
Of the church, at the back door,
You need to hear me out.
And they said, "Speak now",
Fond gestures are exchanged,
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march,
And I am hiding in the curtains,
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be.

Oh-oh, oh-oh!
Oh-oh, oh-oh!
You were in college working part time waitin' tables.
Left a small town, never looked back!
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling.
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts!
I say, "Can you believe it?".
As we're lyin' on the couch.
The moment I could see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now!
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together.
And there's a drawer of my things at your place,
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded.
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes!

I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier than ever.
We small talk, work and the weather.
Your guard is up and I know why.
Because the last time you saw me.
Is still burned in the back of your mind?
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.
So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night".
And I go back to December all the time,
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you!
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright.
I go back to December all the time.
These days, I haven't been sleeping.
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call?
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times.
I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
And realized I loved you in the fall,

You, with your words like knives.
And swords and weapons that you use against me,
You have knocked me off my feet again.
Got me feeling like I'm nothing!
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard.
Calling me out when I'm wounded.
You, pickin' on the weaker man.
Well, you can take me down.
But you don't know what you don't know,
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean,
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean,
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides.
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation,
You have pointed out my flaws again.
As if I don't already see them.
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out.
'Cause I'll never impress you!
I just wanna feel okay again.

I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us.
How we met and the sparks flew instantly?
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones",
I used to know my place was the spot next to you.
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat!
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on.
Oh, a simple complication!
Miscommunications lead to fallout,
So many things that I wish you knew,
So many walls up, I can't break through,
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room!
And we're not speakin',
And I'm dyin' to know,
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate.
When it all broke down?
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,

He said the way my blue eyes shined.
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night.
I said, "That's a lie".
Just a boy in a Chevy truck.
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck.
On backroads at night,
And I was right there beside him all summer long,
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone,
But when you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think my favorite song.
The one we danced to all night long.
The moon like a spotlight on the lake.
When you think happiness?
I hope you think that little black dress.
Think of my head on your chest.
And my old faded blue jeans,
When you think Tim McGraw?
I hope you think of me.
September saw a month of tears.
And thankin' God that you weren't here,
To see me like that,
But in a box beneath my bed,
Is a letter that you never read?
From three summers back,

just thought it…,
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy.
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me.
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy,
That's fine, you won't mind if I say.
By the way,
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive!
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'.
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time,
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn.
There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge.
There's nothin' stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends.
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me,
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be.
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive!
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'.
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time,
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn.
And if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself,
'Cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health.

Drew looks at me,
I fake a smile so he won't see.
That I want and I'm needing.
Everything that we should be!
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about.
And she's got everything that I have to live without!
Drew talks to me,
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny.
That I can't even see.
Anyone when he's with me.
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right.
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night.
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star.
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do.
Drew walks by me,
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be.

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me.
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out.
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking?
Trying to see through the rain coming down.
Even though I'm not the only one.
Who feels the way I do.
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know.
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on.
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world!
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans!
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve,
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine.
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah,
But that's okay,
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know.
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on.
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world!

You have a way of coming easily to me.
And when you take, you take the very best of me,
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something,
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted,
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending!
Given to a perfect day.
Just walk away, ain't no use defending.
Words that you will never say!
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you!
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray.
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away,
And you come away with a great little story,
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you,
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending!
Given to a perfect day.
So just walk away, ain't no use defending,
Words that you will never say!
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you!

It’s about what I was going through….
I didn't know what I would find.
When I went looking for a reason, I know?
I didn't read between the lines.
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go!
I tried to take the road less traveled by.
But nothing seems to work the first few times!
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in!
I can still see you, this ain't the best view.
On the outside looking in,
I've been a lot of lonely places.
I've never been on the outside!
You saw me there, but never knew!
That I would give it all up to be.
A part of this, a part of you.
And now, it's all too late, so you see,
You could've helped if you had wanted to.
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything,

I wrote  about one of….
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty.
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you?
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty.
But that's not true,
'Cause I know you,
Hold on, baby, you're losing it.
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go.
And no one knows,
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone.
That you might not be the golden one.
And you're tied together with a smile,
But you're coming undone, oh,
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted.
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change.
Hoping it will end up in his pocket.
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain,
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay!
It's not his price to pay.
Hold on, baby, you're losing it.
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go.
And no one knows,
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone.
That you might not be the golden one.
And you're tied together with a smile,
But you're coming undone, oh,
Oh, oh!

Cory's eyes are like a jungle.
He smiles, it's like the radio.
He whispers songs into my window.
In words that nobody knows!
There's pretty girls on every corner.
They watch him as he's walking home.
Saying, "Does he know?",
Will you ever know?
You're beautiful, every little piece, love.
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone,
And when you find everything you looked for!
I hope your life leads you back to my door.
Oh, but if it don't!
Stay beautiful,
Cory finds another way to be.
The highlight of my day.
I'm taking pictures in my mind.
So I can save 'em for a rainy day,
It's hard to make a conversation.
When he's taking my breath away?
I should say, "Hey, by the way".

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing.
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone!
Yesterday, I found out about you!
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong.
You say that you'd take it all back.
Given one chance,
It was a moment of weakness.
And you said yes,
You should've said no, you should've gone home.
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go.
You should've known that word.
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me.
And I should've been there in the back of your mind,
I shouldn't be asking myself why.
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet.
You should've said no.
Baby, and you might still have me!
You can see that I've been cryin'.
And baby, you know all the right things to say,
But do you honestly expect me to believe,
We could ever be the same?

She said I was seven and you were nine.
I looked at you like the stars that shined.
In the sky, the pretty lights,
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us,
Growing up and falling in love.
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes,
And said,
"Oh, my, my, my",
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree.
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me.
You never did, you never did!
Take me back when our world was one block wide.
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried.
Just two kids, you and I.
Oh, my, my, my, my!
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly.
I wasn't that little girl you used to see.
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights,
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us,
They never believed we'd really fall in love!
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes,
And said, "Oh, my, my, my",

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone.
In the front seat of his car,
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel.
The other on my heart.
I look around, turn the radio down.
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?".
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song".
And he says,
Our song is a slammin' screen door.
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window.
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow?
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know.
Our song is the way you laugh.
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have".
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen",
Askin' God if he could play it again.
I was walking up the front porch steps.
After everythin' that day,
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on?
And lost and thrown away,
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed!
I almost didn't notice all the roses.
And the note that said,

Friday night beneath the stars.
In a field behind your yard,
You and I are painting pictures in the sky.
And sometimes, we don't say a thing,
Just listen to the crickets sing.
Everything I need is right here by my side!
And I know everything about you!
I don't wanna live without you.
I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground?
It's like no matter what I do.
Well, you drive me crazy half the time.
The other half, I'm only tryin' to.
Let you know that what I feel is true!
And I'm only me when I'm with you,
Just a small-town boy and girl.
Livin' in a crazy world.
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true.
And I don't try to hide my tears,
My secrets or my deepest fears.
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do!

She can't see the way your eyes.
Light up when you smile.
She'll never notice how you stop and stare!
Whenever she walks by?
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her,
But you are everything to me!
And I just wanna show you,
She don't even know you.
She's never gonna love you like I want to!
And you just see right through me,
But if you only knew me,
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable.
Instead of just invisible,
Oh, yeah, oh!
There's a fire inside of you.
That can't help but shine through.
She's never gonna see the light!
No matter what you do!

It appears as the….
Why would you wanna break?
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take?
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make?
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break?
A perfectly good heart?
Maybe I should've seen the signs.
Should've read the writing on the wall?
And realized by the distance in your eyes,
That I would be the one to fall.
No matter what you say!
I still can't believe that you would walk away.
It don't make sense to me, but.
Why would you wanna break?
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take?
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make?
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break?
A perfectly good heart?

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors.
It's the mornin' of your very first day.
You say "hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while.
Try and stay out of everybody's way.
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here.
For the next four years in this town,
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say.
"You know, I haven't seen you around before".
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you!
You're gonna believe them,
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out,
Well, count to ten, take it in.
This is life before you know who you're gonna be.
Fifteen,
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail.
And soon enough, you're best friends,
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool.
We'll be outta here as soon as we can.
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car,
And you're feelin' like flyin',
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one,
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends,
When the night ends?

Mmm-mm, mm-mm,
Mmm-mm, mm-mm,
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah,
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving.
But I know I saw a light in you,
And as we walked, we were talking,
I didn't say half the things I wanted to.
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window,
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing.
I don't always have to be alone!
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel.
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so?
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you!
Can't help it if there's no one else?
Mmm, I can't help myself.
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling.
So I got some things to say to you, ha,
I've seen it all, so I thought.
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do!
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name.
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same.

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel.
Comes out just when you need it to!
As I paced back and forth all this time.
'Cause I honestly believed in you.
Holdin' on, the days drag on.
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known.
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale.
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell.
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town.
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down.
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse!
To come around,
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes.
And never really had a chance!
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love.
You had to fight to have the upper hand.
I had so many dreams about you and me.
Happy endings, now, I know.
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale.
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell.
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town.
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down.
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse!
To come around,

I see your face in my mind as I drive away.
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds.
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time,

Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie.
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see.
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down.
Now, I don't know what to be without you around!

And we know it's never simple, never easy!
Never a clean break,
no one here to save me!
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.

And I can't,
breathe,
without you, but I have to,
Breathe without you, but I have to.

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt!
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve.
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out!

I walked into Liz’s house, and I….
I took a chance, I took a shot.
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not,
You took a swing, I took it hard.
And down here from the ground, I see who you are,
I'm sick and tired of your attitude.
I'm feeling like I don't know you.
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down.
And I need you like a heartbeat,
But you know you got a mean streak,
That makes me run for cover when you're around.
And here's to you and your temper,
Yes, I remember what you said last night!
And I know that you see what you're doing to me,
Tell me why,
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day.
Well, I get so confused and frustrated.
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh.
I'm sick and tired of your reasons.
I got no one to believe in.
You tell me that you want me, then push me around.
And I need you like a heartbeat,
But you know you got a mean streak,
That makes me run for cover when you're around.
Here's to you and your temper.
Yes, I remember what you said last night!
And I know that you see what you're doing to me,
Tell me why,

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around.
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down.
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out,
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around,
You don't have to call anymore.
I won't pick up the phone.
This is the last straw.
Don't wanna hurt anymore?
And you can tell me that you're sorry,
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before,
You're not sorry,
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know.
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold?
And you've got your share of secrets,
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh,
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before,
But you don't have to call anymore,
I won't pick up the phone.
This is the last straw.
Don't wanna hurt anymore?
And you can tell me that you're sorry,
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before,
You're not sorry,
You're not sorry,

He is sensible and so incredible.
He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better!
He opens up my door and I get into his car.
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight",
And I feel perfectly fine,
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain,
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name,
You're so in love that you act insane.
And that's the way I loved you,
Breaking down and coming undone.
It's a roller coaster kind of rush.
And I never knew I could feel that much!
And that's the way I loved you,
He respects my space.
And never makes me wait!
And he calls exactly when he says he will,
He's close to my mother.
Talks business with my father.
He's charming and,
endearing,
And I'm comfortable,

Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye.
And we caught onto something,
I hold onto the night.
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me.
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me.
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak!
I don't feel welcome anymore.
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me!
'Cause one second, it was perfect.
Now, you're halfway out the door!
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called,
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all!
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"!
Oh, and it!
rains in your bedroom,
Everything is wrong!
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone.
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"!
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes.
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure.
So here's to everything coming down to nothing!
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core.
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore.


I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on.
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run.
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides.
Look now, the sky is gold.
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home.
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall.
But I know you're not scared of anything at all,
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away?
But I know I had the best day with you today,
I'm thirteen now,
And don't know how my friends could be so mean,
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys.
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away,
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names,
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school.
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you,
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay?
But I know I had the best day with you today,

And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you,
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and!
You know it's all the same, another time and place.
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it.
But I believe in whatever you do,
And I'll do anything to see it through,
Because these things will change.
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down.
This revolution, the time will come.
For us to finally win,
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah,
Oh, oh!
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered,
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair.
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found!
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared!
You can walk away, say we don't need this.
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this,
'Cause these things will change.
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down.
This revolution, the time will come.
For us to finally win,
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah,
Oh, oh!

I like the way you sound in the morning.
We're on the phone and without a warning.
I realize your laugh is the best sound.
I have ever heard.
I like the way I can't keep my focus.
I watch you talk, you didn't notice.
I hear the words but all I can think is.
"We should be together",
Every time you smile, I smile.
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you,
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby.
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall?
Jump, then fall into me.
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you!
Say that you wanna be with me too.
'Cause I'ma stay through it all.
So, jump, then fall,
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face.
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh.
I've never been so wrapped up, honey!
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted!
I had time to think it oh-over.
And all I can say is, "Come closer",
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me.

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky.
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why.
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you.
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun.
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone,
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream,
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name.
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven!
It's half full and I won't wait here all day.
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway.
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun,
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone,
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream,
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name.
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, oh!
In the middle of the night waking from this dream,
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me.
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven!

Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye.
We caught onto something.
I hold onto the night.
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me.
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me.
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak!
I don't feel welcome anymore.
Baby, what happened? Please tell me!
'Cause one second it was perfect.
Now you're halfway out the door!
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called,
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all!
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"!
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong!
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone.
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"!
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy.
I looked into your eyes.
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure.
So here's to everything coming down to nothing!
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core.
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore.

I could go back to every laugh.
But I don't wanna go there anymore,
And I know all the steps up to your door,
But I don't wanna go there anymore,
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky.
Talk to the man with the reasons why.
And let me know what you find,
I'll leave my window open.
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name.
Just know I'm right here hoping.
That you'll come in with the rain.
I could stand up and sing you a song.
But I don't wanna have to go that far,
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart,
And you don't even know where I start,
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears.
Talk to the man who put you here.
And don't wait for the sky to clear,

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like.
There ain’t nothing more right babe!
Misty morning comes again and I can't.
Help but wish I could see your face.
And I knew from the first note played,
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you.
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row.
Scream your name,
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like,
"I can't take my eyes off of you".
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl.
Who's desperately in love with you.
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar.
Morning loneliness,
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you!
When my world wakes up today?
You'll be in another town.
And I knew when I saw your face,
I'd be counting down the ways to see you.
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name.

In the heat of the fight, I walked away,
Ignoring words that you were saying.
Tryin' to make me stay.
And you've called a hundred times,
But I'm not picking up,
'Cause I'm so mad,
I might tell you that it's over.
But if you look a little closer,
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you.
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles,
Screaming, "I'm in love with you".
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more.
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on,
The other side of the door.
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone.
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone!
I keep going back over things we both said.
And I remember the slamming door,
And all the things that I misread,

Today was a fairytale, you were the prince.
I used to be a damsel in distress.
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six.
Today was a fairytale,
Today was a fairytale,
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress.
You wore a dark gray t-shirt.
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess.
Today was a fairytale,
Time slows down,
Whenever you're around?
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me.
Fell in love when I saw you standing there.
It must have been the way.
Today was a fairytale,
It must have been the way.
Today was a fairytale,

Mr. "Perfect face," Mr. "Here to stay".
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"!
Everything was right, Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life"!
But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart",
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart.
It takes everything in me just to get up each day!
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay,
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"!
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby!
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"!
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"!
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye.
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine",
Mr. "Never told me why,"!
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"!
Mr. "Insincere apology, so he doesn't look like the bad guy".
He goes about his day, forgets he ever even heard my name.
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same.

We used to walk along the streets.
When the porch lights were shinin' bright?
Before I had somewhere to be!
Back when we had all night.
And we were happy,
I do recall a good while back.
We snuck into the circus.
You threw your arms around my neck.
Back when I deserved it.
And we were happy,
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby?
We showed 'em all up.
No one could touch the way we!
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm.
We were gonna buy someday.
And we were happy,
We used to watch the Sun go down.
On the boats in the water,
That's sorta how I feel right now.
And goodbye's so much harder,
'Cause we were happy,

Elevator buttons and morning air.
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs.
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares.
But right now, my time is theirs,
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves!
They'll judge it like they know about me and you.
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do!
The jury's out, but my choice is you.
So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine.
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high, the water's rough.
But this love is ours,
You never know what people have up their sleeves!
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me.
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles.
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine,
And you'll say,
Don't you worry your pretty little mind?
People throw rocks at things that shine.
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high, the water's rough.
But this love is ours,

All I knew this morning when I woke.
Is I know something now?
Know something now I didn't before.
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago,
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile?
In the back of my mind, making me feel like,
I just wanna know you better.
Know you better, know you better now.
I just wanna know you better.
Know you better, know you better now.
I just wanna know you better.
Know you better, know you better now.
I just wanna know you, know you, know you.
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello".
And your eyes look like coming home,
All I know is a simple name.
And everything has changed!
All I know is you held the door.
You'll be mine and I'll be yours.
All I know since yesterday.
Is everything has changed?

Midnight,
You come and pick me up, no headlights.
Long drive,
Could end in burning flames or paradise?
Fade into view, oh,
It's been a while since I have even heard from you.
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I,
Know exactly where it leads, but I.
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time.
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye.
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like,
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time,
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style!
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt.
And I got that good-girl faith and a tight little skirt,
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time,
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style!
So it goes,
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm.
Takes me home,
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh.
That you've been out and about with some other girl".
Some other girl,

Looking at it now,
It all seems so simple.
We were lying on your couch.
I remember.
You took a Polaroid of us.
Then discovered,
The rest of the world was black and white.
But we were in screaming color,
And I remember thinking,
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good?
Looking at it now,
Last December,
We were built to fall apart.
Then fall back together,
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck.
The night we couldn't quite forget.
When we decided, we decided?
To move the furniture so we could dance,
Baby, like we stood a chance!
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying.
And I remember thinking,

He said, "Let's get out of this town.
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds".
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now".
Nothing lasts forever!
But this is gonna take me down,
He's so tall and handsome as hell.
He's so bad, but he does it so well.
I can see the end as it begins.
My one condition is,
Say you'll remember me,
Standin' in a nice dress.
Starin' at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks.
Say you'll see me again.
Even if it's just in your.
Wildest dreams, ah, ha,
Wildest dreams, ah, ha,
I said, "No one has to know what we do".
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room.
And his voice is a familiar sound,
Nothin' lasts forever!
But this is gettin' good now,

Been sittin' eyes wide open.
Behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call.
It's just a cruel existence.
Like it's no point hopin' at all.
Baby, baby, I feel crazy!
Up all night, all night and every day.
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'.
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever!
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain.
And I don't wanna fit wherever,
I just wanna keep calling your name.
Until you come back home.
I just wanna keep calling your name.
Until you come back home.
I just wanna keep calling your name.
Until you come back home.
I'm sittin' eyes wide open.
And I got one thing stuck in my mind,
Wonderin' if I dodged a bullet.
Or just lost the love of my life, oh,

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him.
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted.
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom,
Holdin' him for ransom, some.
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though.
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so.
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever!
Like a vendetta-ta,
I, I, I see how this is gon' go.
Touch me and you'll never be alone!
I-Island breeze and lights down low.
No one has to know!
In the middle of the night, in my dreams,
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm.
In the middle of the night, in my dreams,
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time.
Are you ready for it?
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me.
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry!
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and,
We'll move to an island and.
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure.
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now.
Never be the same now, now!


I wanna be your end game.
I wanna be your first string.
I wanna be your A-Team (.
Woah, woah,
I wanna be your end game, end game.

Future,
Big reputation, big reputation,
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah.
And you heard about me, ooh,
I got some big enemies.
Yeah!
Big reputation, big reputation,
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah.
Git, git,
And I heard about you, ooh,
Yeah!
You like the bad ones too.
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast.
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat.
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me.
I'm one call away whenever you need me!
I'm in a G5 , come to the A-Side.
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like.
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type.
You hold me down and I protect you with my life.

This ain't for the best.
My reputation's never been worse, so!
You must like me for me.
We can't make.
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink,
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black.
Come here, you can meet me in the back!
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you.
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue!
Just think of the fun things we could do.
This ain't for the best.
My reputation's never been worse, so!
You must like me for me.
We can't make.
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink,
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate.
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate.

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January.
And this is our place, we make the rules,
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear,
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah!
Take me out and take me home.
You're my, my, my, my lover.
We could let our friends crash in the living room.
This is our place, we make the call.
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you!
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all.
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah!
Take me out and take me home.
You're my, my, my, my lover.

I would be complex, I would be cool.
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to.
And that would be okay for me to do,
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you.
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type.
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can.
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man.
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again,
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man.
I'd be the man,
I’d be the man,
They’d say I hustled, put in the work.
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve.
What I was wearing, if I was rude?
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves?
And they would toast to me, oh , let the players play,
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez.

You are somebody that I don't know!
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón,
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM,
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out.
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out,
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?",
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression,
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun!
And snakes and stones never broke my bones!
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
You need to calm down, you're being too loud.
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh,
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down.
You are somebody that we don't know!
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile,
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?
Sunshine on the street at the parade.
But you would rather be in the dark ages,
Makin' that sign must've taken all night.

I promise that you'll never find another like me!
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh.
I know I never think before I jump!
And you're the kinda guy the ladies want,
I know that I went psycho on the phone.
I never leave well enough alone!
And trouble's gonna follow where I go,
But one of these things is not like the others,
Like a rainbow with all of the colors.
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover!
I promise that you'll never find another like!
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
I'm the only one of me.
Baby, that's the fun of me!
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
You're the only one of you.
Baby, that's the fun of you!
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night.
You know that I caught it (.
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it!
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price.
You know that I bought it (.
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it!
Killing me slow, out the window.
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below!
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes.
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more?
And it's new, the shape of your body,
It's blue, the feeling I've got.
And it's ooh, woah-oh,
It's a cruel summer,
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em.
No rules in breakable heaven!
But ooh, woah-oh,
It's a cruel summer with you.
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine.
I'm not dying (,
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it!
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times.
We're not trying (,
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it!

It keeps me awake, the look on your face.
The moment you heard the news.
You're screaming inside and frozen in time.
You did all that you could do.
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked.
The wrong ones think they’re right.
You were outnumbered this time.
But only the young, only the young,
Only the young, only the young.
Can run?
Can run?
So run, and run, and run,
So every day now,
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV.
You go to class, scared.
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be.
And the big bad man and his big bad clan,
Their hands are stained with red.
Oh, how quickly they forget!
They aren't gonna help us.
Too busy helping themselves,
They aren't gonna change this.
We gotta do it ourselves.
They think that it's over.
But it's just begun,

We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts.
I'm standing there,
On a balcony in summer air,
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd.
And say, "Hello",
Little did I know,
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles.
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet",
And I was crying on the staircase,
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said.
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone!
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".
So I sneak out to the garden to see you,
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh.

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine.
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine.
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree,
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh,
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles.
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love!
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life!
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of,
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton,
Taylor Swift,
But now that we're done and it's over,
I bet you couldn't believe.
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave?
And I bet you think about me,
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community.
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills.
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion.
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills.
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for,
And you and I fell like an early spring snow,
But reality crept in, you said we're too different,
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes.

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold.
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now,
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze!
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate.
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place.
And I can picture it after all these days,
And I know it's long gone and,
That magic's not here no more.
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all,
Oh, oh, oh!
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there.
I remember it all too well.
your cheeks were turnin' red.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed.
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the,
tee-ball team,
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me.
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy",
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town!
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now,
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was!
'Til we were dead and gone and buried.
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same.
After three months in the grave,
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you,
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame,

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind!
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind?
In the shoes I gave you as a present,
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five.
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight,
Best believe I'm still bejeweled.
When I walk in the room?
I can still make the whole place shimmer.
And when I meet the band,
They ask, "Do you have a man?".
I could still say,
"I don't remember",
Familiarity breeds contempt,
Don't put mе in the basement?
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart.
Diamonds in my eyes,
I polish up real, I polish up real nice.
Nice,
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl!
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve?
I think it's time to teach some lessons.
I made you my world , have you heard?
I can reclaim the land.
And I miss you , but I miss sparklin',

Inspired by a line from….
Meet me at midnight,
Staring at the ceiling with you.
Oh, you don't ever say too much!
And you don't really read into,
My melancholia,
I been under scrutiny.
You handle it beautifully.
All this shit is new to me.
I feel.
The lavender haze creeping up on me.
Surreal,
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say.
No deal!
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze.
All they keep asking me.
Is if I'm gonna be your bride?
The only kinda girl they see.
Is a one-night or a wife?

I-I-I-I,
You brush past me in the hallway.
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I’ve been watchin' you for ages.
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it,
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me.
And I could see you up against the wall with me,
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew,
That I can see you.
I-I-I-I,
And we kept everything professional!
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like,
They keep watchful eyes on us.
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet,
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head.
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet.

Hi!…,
He said, "Let's get out of this town.
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds".
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now".
Nothing lasts forever!
But this is gonna take me down,
He's so tall and handsome as hell.
He's so bad, but he does it so well.
I can see the end as it begins.
My one condition is,
Say you'll remember me,
Standin' in a nice dress.
Starin' at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks.
Say you'll see me again.
Even if it's just in your.
Wildest dreams, ah, ha,
Wildest dreams, ah, ha,
I said, "No one has to know what wе do".
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room.
And his voicе is a familiar sound,
Nothin' lasts forever!
But this is gettin' good now,

I was supposed to be sent away.
But they forgot to come and get me,
I was a functioning alcoholic.
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic!
All of this to say I hope you're okay.
But you're the reason,
And no one here's to blame,
But what about your quiet treason?
And for a fortnight there, we were forever!
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather.
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors!
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her.
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift,
Post Malone,
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an.
endless February,
I took the miracle move-on drug, the.
effects were temporary,
And I love you, it's ruining my life,
I love you, it's ruining my life.
I touched you for only a fortnight.
I touched you.
, but I touched you.
[Chorus: Taylor Swift,
And for a fortnight there,
we were forever!
Run into you sometimes, ask.
about the weather,
Now you're in my backyard, turned!
into good neighbors,
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her.
And for a fortnight there,
we were together.
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater.
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors!
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him.

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold.
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow,
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now,
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze!
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place.
And I can picture it after all these days,
And I know it's long gone and,
That magic's not here no more.
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all,
Oh, oh, oh!
'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there.
I remember it all too well.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed.
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy",
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town!
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now,
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was!
'Til we were dead and gone and buried.
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same.
After three months in the grave,
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you,
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame,

So  long , London,
So  long , London,
So  long , London,
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist.
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift.
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away.
My spine split from carrying us up the hill.
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill.
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe.
Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had.
Did you think I had in me?"?
Oh, the tragedy!
So long, London,
You'll find someone,
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out.
I founded the club she's heard great things about.
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath.
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use.
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to!
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free,

You left your typewriter at my apartment.
Straight from,
the tortured poets department,
I think some things I never say!
Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?".
But you're in self-sabotage mode,
Throwing spikes down on the road.
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show,
Who else decodes you?
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said.
"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith.
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots".
And who's gonna hold you like me?
Nobody!
No-fucking-body!
Nobody!
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate.
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.
I scratch your head, you fall asleep.
Like a tattooed golden retriever.
But you awaken with dread,
Pounding nails in your head.
But I've read this one where you come undone,
I chose this cyclone with you.

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames.
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away.
Stitching, "We were just kids, babe".
I said, "I don't mind, it takes time".
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed.
I felt aglow like this.
Never before and never since!
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary.
You and I go from one kiss to getting married.
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery.
Never quite buried!
In your suit and tie,
in the nick of time,
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy.
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life.
You said I'm the love of your life.
About a million times,
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate.
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes?
Well, you took me to hell too.
And all at once, the ink bleeds,
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme.
But I've felt a hole like this,
Never before and ever since!

I can see you standing, honey.
With his arms around your body,
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all.
And it took you five whole minutes,
To pack us up and leave me with it,
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall.
I think I've seen this film before.
And I didn't like the ending,
You're not my homeland anymore.
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out.
I think I've seen this film before.
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
I can see you starin', honey.
Like he's just your understudy.
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me.
Second, third, and hundredth chances.
Balancin' on breaking branches,
Those eyes add insult to injury.

I forget how the West was won.
I forget if this was ever fun.
I just learned these people only raise you.
To cage you,
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best.
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess".
I just learned these people try and save you.
'Cause they hate you,
Too high a horse,
For a simple girl,
To rise above it,
They slammed the door.
On my whole world,
The one thing I wanted.
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned!
Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him".
I'm havin' his baby,
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces!
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences.
No, I'm not coming to my senses!
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want.

Seneler sürer her günüm,
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah.
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum,
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah.
Seneler sürer her günüm,
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah.
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum,
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah.
I usually love sleeping all alone.
This time around, bring your friend with you.
But we ain't really gonna sleep at all,
You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures.
In my city, I'm a young god,
That pussy kill be so vicious.
My god white, he in my pocket.
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous.
She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often".
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often".
Bitches down to do it either way, often!
Baby, I can make that pussy rain, often!
Often, often, girl, I do this often.
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it.
Often, often, girl, I do this often.
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it.
Often,

The Weeknd…,
I've been mixin', I've been sippin'.
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl.
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'.
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water.
I want you, now now.
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now.
Don't take my number, don't want your number?
I'll call you back if that head right baby.
I won't love you, I can't love you.
Unless that pussy got some super powers.
I want you, now now.
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now.
And I woke up in the kitchen saying,
"How the hell did this shit happen?".
Oh baby, drunk in love!
We be all night.
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club.
Drunk in love,
We be all night, love, baby, love.
We be all night, love, baby, love.

I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast.
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas.
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace.
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous!
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates.
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph.
Mix it in a potion like a science.
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet.
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin'.
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher!
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas.
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private.
My flight too private,
, my shows so riot.
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall.
Then it's time for me to fly her.
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet.
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it,
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it.
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it.
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it.
Baby girl, you know what I like!
Baby, you know just what I like!
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like!

I'ma care for you,
I'ma care for you, you, you, you.
You make it look like it's magic.
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you!
I'm never confused!
Hey, hey,
And I'm so used to bein' used,
So I love when you call unexpected,
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected.
So I'ma care for you, you, you,
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah.
'Cause girl, you're perfect,
You're always worth it!
And you deserve it,
The way you work it.
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah.
Girl, you earned it, yeah.
You know our love would be tragic.
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind,
We live with no lies.
Hey, hey,
You're my favorite kind of night.

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Your man on the road, he doin' promo.
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low".
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone.
'Cause you look even better than the photos.
I can't find your house, send me the info.
Drivin' through the gated residential.
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home.
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know.
I only call you when it's half-past five.
The only time that I'll be by your side.
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me.
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me?
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah?
I only call you when it's half-past five.
The only time I'd ever call you mine.
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me.
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me?
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe?

And I know she'll be the death of me,
At least we'll both be numb,
And she'll always get the best of me!
The worst is yet to come.
But at least we'll both be beautiful,
And stay forever young!
This I know, uh,
This I know,
She told me, "Don't worry.
About it",
She told me, "Don't worry.
No more"!
We both know we can't go.
Without it,
She told me, "You'll never!
Be alo-oh-oh-ooh",
I can't feel my face when I'm with you.
But I love it,
But I love it, oh,
I can't feel my face when I'm with you.
But I love it,
But I love it, oh,

Ayy,
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah.
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah.
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah.
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah.
None of these toys on lease too, ah!
Made your whole year in a week too, yah.
Main bitch outta your league too, ah.
Side bitch outta your league too, ah.
House so empty, need a centerpiece.
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony.
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces.
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah.
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid.
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade.
Switch up my style, I take any lane.
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain.
Look what you've done,
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy,
Look what you've done,
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy,

We found each other.
I helped you out of a broken place.
You gave me comfort.
But falling for you was my mistake,
I put you on top, I put you on top.
I claimed you so proud and openly.
And when times were rough, when times were rough,
I made sure I held you close to me.
So call out my name,
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently.
I want you to stay.
I want you to stay even though you don't want me.
Girl, why can't you wait?
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name?
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and.
I'll be on my—,
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied!
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life.
Guess I was just another pit stop.
'Til you made up your mind.
You just wasted my time.

Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro.
Ayy,
Young Metro, young Metro,
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need!
Tryna find the one that can fix me.
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed.
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly.
Yeah, I want it all now!
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound.
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound.
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down!
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless?
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless,
All this money and this pain got me heartless.
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless.
Said I'm heartless,
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless.
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless!
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless.
Said I'm heartless,
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket,
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit.
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit.
Yeah, I got her watchin'!
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet.
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket.
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target!
Photoshoots, I'm a star now.
I'm talkin',

Rolling Stone,
and,
Bazaar,
now!
Bazaar,
now!
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down.
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now.

Yeah!
I've been tryna call,
I've been on my own for long enough.
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe.
I'm goin' through withdrawals,
You don't even have to do too much.
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby.
I look around and.
Sin City's cold and empty.
No one's around to judge me!
I can't see clearly when you're gone.
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights.
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch!
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night.
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust!
Hey, hey, hey,
I'm running out of time.
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky.
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh,

Thought I almost died in my dream again.
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again.
I'm fallin' in too deep.
Without you, I can't sleep,
'Cause my heart belongs to you.
I'll risk it all for you.
I want you next to me.
This time, I'll never leave!
I wanna share babies.
Protection, we won't need,
Your body next to me.
Is just a memory?
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh.
Without you, I can't sleep,
Insomnia relieve, oh,
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe.
My darkest hours,
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room.
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you.
I turned into the man I used to be, to be.
Put myself to sleep,
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams.
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me?
I just wanted to call you and say, and say.

Ooh, yeah,
I just pretend that I'm in the dark and.
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss.
I'd rather be so oblivious.
I'd rather be with you.
When it's said, when it's done, yeah?
I don't ever wanna know.
I can tell what you done, yeah.
When I look at you?
In your eyes,
I see there's something burning inside you.
Oh, inside you!
In your eyes,
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to.
Oh, you try to!
You always try to hide the pain!
You always know just what to say!
I always look the other way!
I'm blind, I'm blind,
In your eyes,
You lie, but I don't let it define you.
Oh, define you!

Ooh,
Na-na, yeah,
I saw you dancing in a crowded room.
You look so happy when I'm not with you.
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise,
I don't know why I run away.
I make you cry when I run away.
You could've asked me why I broke your heart.
You could've told me that you fell apart.
But you walked past me like I wasn't there,
And just pretended like you didn't care,
I don't know why I run away.
I make you cry when I run away.
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay.
Save your tears for another.

Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I saw the fire in your eyes.
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes.
You tell me things you wanna try.
I know temptation is the devil in disguise.
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah.
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice.
You said you do this all the time.
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light.
It's like a dream what she feels with me.
She loves to be on the edge.
Her fantasy is okay with me.
Then suddenly, baby says,
Take my breath away,
And make it last forever, babe!
Do it now or never, babe?
Take my breath away,
Nobody does it better, babe!
Bring me close to—,

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through.
I just can't say I don't love you.
'Cause I love you, yeah.
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold.
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know,
Let me tell the truth!
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah!
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes.
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry.
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night.
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time.
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love.
I try to find a reason to pull us apart.
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfеct.
And I know that you're worth it,
I can't walk away, oh.

Even though we'rе goin' through it.
And it makes you feel alone,
Just know that I would die for you.
Ooh, ooh,
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah!
The distance and the time between us.
Distance and the time,
It'll never change my mind 'cause!
Baby, I would die for you!
I would die for you.
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah!

Lock me up and throw away the key.
He knows how to get the best out of me.
I'm no force for the world to see.
Trade my whole life just to be.
Tell nobody I control you!
I broke you just to own you.
They can't tell but I love you.
'Cause you're loyal, baby,
I love when you're submissive.
You love it when I break skin.
You feel pain without flinchin'.
So say it,
Give me tough love,
Leave me with nothin' when I come down.
My kind of love,
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out.
We don't gotta bе in love, no.
I don't gotta be the onе, no.
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight.
We don't gotta be in love, no.
I don't gotta be the one, no.
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh.

I've seen the devil,
Down Sunset?
In every place,
In every face,
Yeah!
Yeah!
Tell me, do you see her?  She's livin' her life.
Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight.
But if you knew her , she lives a lie,
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised.
Oh, I know what she needs!
She just want the fame, I know what shе fiends.
Give hеr a little taste, runnin' back to me.
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh.
Ooh, every night , she prays to the sky.
Flashin' lights is all she ever wants to see.
Beggin' on her knees to be popular.
That's her dream, to be popular.
Kill anyone to be popular.
Sell her soul to be popular.
Just to be popular,
Everybody scream 'cause she popular.
She mainstream 'cause she popular.
Never be free 'cause she popular!

Sun is shining, it's over.
It's tomorrow,
Bathe yourself in the light, in your love.
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, no.

Ice on my neck, double-O wrist.

Fresh out the trench, four hundred packs.
Uh, yeah, I'm spinnin' in Paris.
Dress for these hoes, they finna flock.
Just poured a four in a soda, it pop.

I'm wrestlin' all of my demons, I feel like The Rock.

Bota na boca, bota na cara, bota onde quiser.
Bota na boca, bota na cara, bota onde quiser.
O novinho me olhou e quis comer minha pepequinha.
Hoje eu vou dar pro novinho, fode, fode a larissinha.

Every time I try to pray you away, you got me on my knees.
I surrender at your feet, baby, put it all on me.

Turn me on,

Traffic dies while we are racin' home.
Melted lights cover the open road.
I hope we make it 'cause I've been chasin'.
Another odyssey, oh,
I can't wait to see your face.
Crash when we're switchin' lanes.
My love's beyond the pain.
But if I miss the brake,
We're dancin' in the flames.
It's indescribable,
Ooh, yeah,
"The world can't heal," they say on the radio.
So grab the wheel, want you to be in control,
We're dodgin' headlights, and you say, "Hold tight".
Another odyssey, oh,

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through.
I just can't say I don't love you.
'Cause I love you, yeah.
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold.
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know,
Let me tell the truth!
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah!
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes.
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry.
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night.
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time.
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love.
I try to find a reason to pull us apart.
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect.
And I know that you're worth it,
I can't walk away, oh.
Even though we're goin' through it.
And it makes you feel alone,
Just know that I would die for you.
Baby, I would die for you, yeah!
The distance and the time between us.
It'll never change my mind 'cause!
Baby, I would die for you!
Baby, I would die for you, yeah!

Record man play my song on the radio.
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul.
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke.
And I swear too much on the regular,
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go.
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go.
I just won a new award for a kids show.
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow.
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice.
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy!
Whip game, make a nigga understand though.
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo!
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate.
All my niggas blew up like a propane.
All these R&B niggas be so lame.
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein!
You know me, know me, uh,
na-na-na-na-na,
You know me, know me, know me,
oh-oh-oh!
You know me, know me, know me,

Every time you try to forget who I am.
I'll be right there to remind you again.
You know me.
You know me.
