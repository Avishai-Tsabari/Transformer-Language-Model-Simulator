Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home,
you're like a dream come true
But, if by chance, you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie, you sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together at Skyfall
At Skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Just the guitar, okay, cool
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me, mmm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me, mmm
That was what you told me
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I built a house for a love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears
But, oh my
Oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Tryna learn to lean into it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right

You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
You crossed the line and it's time to say "F you"
What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try
staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope
but I still
can't let you go

We're not in love
We share no stories
Just somethin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side
Fall into the dark side
Give in to the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side

I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment before I go, it's nothing personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand
So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
Blep, yah, yah
Farru
Yah-yah-yah-yah

Hello, sweet grief
I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the mornin' after ecstasy
I am drownin' in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doin' everything I can
To make sure I never love again
I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

We were young, posters on the wall
Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
We would stare at each other
'Cause we were always in trouble
And all the cool kids did their own thing
I was on the outside always looking in
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
They never really cared if I wasn't
We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
Then I saw your face, your forgiving eyes
Looking back at me from the other side
Like you understood me
And I'm never letting you go, oh

Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away

Woah
Eyes up, you've been gone for a fortnight
My love, are you stuck in a fake life?
Can't win, if the prize is to waste your time
Now it's wasting mine
And I know that we're close, but I'm lonely
Make me your only, won't win a trophy
But can it kiss you like this when you hold me?
Missing it lowkey, I'll say it slowly
It's me or the PS5
Tell me how you wanna spend your night
Three's feeling way too tight
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
Me or the PS5
Tell me which of us is more your type
Seems like you can't decide
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
Oh-oh

I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Cold hands, red eyes
Packed two bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
Y-y-y-you think you're so small like you're itty-bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walkin' by strangers on the side of the street
Like a quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of m-m-m-mind, like
Like it's just a waste of time, like-like-like
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world

Hey
I know what I came to do
And that ain't gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
'Cause I won't take the bait
I'm over here doin' what I like
I'm over here workin' day and night
And if my real ain't real enough
I'm sorry for you, babe
Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holdin' us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me (Focus),
f-f-focus on me, woo (Focus on me)
Focus on me (Focus),
f-f-focus on me, woo (Focus on me)
I can tell you're curious
It's written on your lips
Ain't no need to hold it back
Go 'head and talk your shit
I know you're hopin' that I'll react
I know you're hopin' I'm lookin' back
But if my real ain't real enough
Then I don't know what is

Oh, yeah
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'—

You got me some type of way
Ain't used to feelin' this way
I do not know what to say
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face
Now I wanna know how you taste
Usually don't give it away
But you know I'm already thinkin' 'bout it
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"
Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin'
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right, but I don't care
Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
This shit always happen to me
Why can't we just play for keeps?
Practically on my knees
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you already thinkin' 'bout it

Mmm
Hey, yeah
I'm stuck with you
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby

I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothin' at all
It's comin' down on me
Water like misery
It's comin' down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain on me
Mm, oh yeah, baby
Rain on me
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try, mm
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah

Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hopin’ I don't repeat history
Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday
Never need no , no one else, babe
’Cause I'll be
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do
That I won't do, switchin’ for you
Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true
But I get tired of runnin', fuck it
Now, I’m runnin' with you
Said, boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday
Never need no , no onе else, babe
'Causе I'll be

In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on
Come on and walk this way through the fire
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like
"Yes, and?"
Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "What's next?"
"Yes, and?"
Now, I'm so done with caring
What you think, no, I won't hide
Underneath your own projections
Or change my most authentic life

You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman
I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it
And I can be all the things you told me not to be
When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
And he see the universe when I'm the company
It's all in me

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side
I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I—
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side

Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin' , I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up , pickin' it up
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but, boy, I like it
I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We out here vibin'
We vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now
Can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah

Hmm
You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been cravin'
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies
So what you doin' tonight?
Better say, "Doin' you right"
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight
I don't wanna keep you up
But show me, can you keep it up?
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy
I've been drinkin' coffee
And I've been eatin' healthy
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah
Savin' up my energy
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm
Sometimes, it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better 'cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you
So, one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should've been more careful

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
She'll pity the men I know

I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
mm-mm

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on
Survivor
just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

Oh, mm-mm
I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh
"Call me when you're there"
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'"
So now, she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair
Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change , you could borrow
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby
Birds of a feather, we should stick together
, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
I said you
You were the love of my life
The love of my life
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you
Then you tried to break mine
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me
Then you moved on immediately
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
When I said you
You  were the love of my life
The love of my life

Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
Hmm
Well, good things don't last
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
f "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

Billie,
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
She'll pity the men I know

I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
mm-mm

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on
Survivor
just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space

So now, she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair
Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

Billie
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me

I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms
Layin', we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde, huh
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Hey!
Now nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe
And do you mind if I steal a kiss?
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here
Just wanna feel it from you
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

Ah-ooh, ooh, ah-ooh
I want you to breathe me in
Let me be your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition, no fear
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?
Hit me harder again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer again
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh

Are you drunk enough
Not to judge what I'm doin’?
Are you high enough
To excuse that I'm ruined? 'Cause I’m ruined
Is it late enough
For you to come and stay over?
'Cause we're free to love
So tease me, ooh
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything (Tonight)
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain’t no science here
So come get your everything (Tonight)
Tonight
Your everything tonight, uh
Is it loud enough?
’Cause my body is callin' for ya, callin’ for ya
I need someone
To do the things that I do, mhm
I'm heatin' up
Energy's takin’ control
I'm speedin' up
My heartbeat's dancin' alone

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
Summer

I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
Got L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci
Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
We deserve Grammys and some Oscars, damn
They deserve Whammys, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way
We say nothin' more than we need
I say, "Your place" when we leave
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothin' left
Hey, I've been wantin' to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you cryin'
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
ay
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' 'ery girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, a—
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had , best I ever had
Best I ever had , best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there
Yup
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Welcome
To the future, uhh (Blueprint, 3, ay-ay, oh, hey-hey)
Hey, count me in (Blue-print, 3, ay, hey, hey-hey)

Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me

Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Everybody get your mothafuckin' roll on

Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First-last, phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo

Alright!
It's a short life, yeah

D. Hill
D. Hill
Ayy
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

Yeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
"Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"
June, you're a genius
I said, "I respect it, no problem"
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man
trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends
snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you
mad
at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn, coach, put him in"
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah

Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes

It was rough without you
It was rough without you
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star-struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up

Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

Oh man
Oh man, oh man

I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up

You still ain't did shit about the other one

And they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah

Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 a.m. to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love

Late-night when you need, my love

Higher powers taking a hold on me

Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes

Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
You're not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone
Oh, but when you're gone, when you're gone, when you're gone
Oh, baby, all the lights go out
Thinking now that maybe I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
Oh, baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you, do for you, do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock
He can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You'd probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving till late in the night
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, oh, same me
Inside
If you don't like the way I talk
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock
Then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue
You'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

One
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Something in you-ou-ou
Lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

If you don't wanna see me
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Bad Bunny
You know that sometimes I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Eh-eh
Pero contigo es todo o na'
-eh
Yeah-yeah
You're deep in the water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now, but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

If you wanna
run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we
fell into
a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv makin' dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbin' if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothin' but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal 'cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's gettin' dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities stickin' their noses in
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

It's late in the evenin', glass on the side
I've been sat with you for most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Louder
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Na-na-na-na
Mmm
I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Ooh, ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

Build the fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas
We'll
dance in the kitchen
while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bеautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas
The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

I met her smokin' a cigarette in a toilet cubicle
Red  dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful
This  ain't the time or place to start a future, but, darlin', I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere
Well, darlin', here we go again
We  are only man and woman and we all make mistakes
"Don't  you know we're only human?", is what I heard you say
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain
'Cause  I have felt the same, no
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh,  can you see the love in mine?
She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls
Well, darlin', here we go again
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are
And I could put you back together when you come apart
And we should make a start now, oh

It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth
Why am I feelin' so nervous when
Things are goin' so perfect? And
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you

I will remember you
In the way you'd want me to
But it's hard to come to terms right now
Sunset looked today
As if it knew you'd gone away
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down
Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain
Oh, I could be a shoulder, not a burden
And it's time for me to call your son again
And say
She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away
I will remember you
With white wine by the barbecue
On New York at the birthday do, downtown
All that comes to mind
When I think about the time
Is a memory of laughin' out loud

Welcome to the world
I heard your heart beat and lost every word
Just stood there quietly taking in the sound
Of our love
This is gonna hurt
But I'll stand beside you, for better or for worse
And I will find you whenever you're lost
I'll be right here
And ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away
Welcome to the world
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt
Don't let them change you, words are only words
Just like I loved you
And yes, you were the first
A new beginning, bright and unreserved
A beautiful red flower in the earth
Will grow, and I know

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't brеak my boat
The stones crash on the boardwalk
Thе wind rush through the trees
I keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been
Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight"
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get-well-soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But, Mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it, too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you?

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a handprint on the door
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before
This is our luck, baby, running out
Our clothes were never off
We still have our roads to run about
To scale the map, to scale the map to get us back on track
I've seen you in a fight you lost
I've seen you in a fight
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys

Oh, oh, starry-eyed
Hip, oh, sta-a-a-a—
Oh, oh, deye-yrrats
​swolg ydobyrevE, starry-eyed
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning
Handlebars that I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in and I'll throw out my heart and get a new one
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning, ah
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah
Woah, oh, oh
So we burst into colours, colours and carousels
Fall head first like paper planes and playground games

I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
Noises
I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathin'
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world
If I was a sculptor, but, then again, no
Or a girl who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

Stripped to the waist, we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over
Yes, since we found out, since we found out
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could
After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its colour
But now I've seen it through and now I know the truth
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could

We don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race
When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shinin' up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We were lovers for the first time
Running all the red lights
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah
We were sipping on emotions
Smoking and inhaling every moment
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah
We were high and we were sober
We were on and we were over
We were young and now I'm older
But I'd do it all again
Getting drunk on a train track
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes
Ten dollars was a fat stack
I'd do it all again
Bomber jacket and a snapback
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach
"Re: Stacks" on the playback
I'd do it all again
We were lovers on a wild ride
Speeding for the finish line
Come until the end of our time, yeah
Started off as a wildfire
Burning down the bridges to our empire
Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah

You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin
Is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both hate everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me (Woo)
You can never come too close for comfort
I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn
I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover
And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber
Iced out body, didn't go to college
Price tag poppin', then you on a private
Don't say sorry, everyone's watchin'
When you're where I am, everything's timeless

Remember me in a simple way, not what I did or said
When I think of you now, I just think of the day we met
Don't forget me, like I didn't care
Yeah, I stole from myself just to make you complete
I don't think you have the patience
I don't think you know the difference
And I don't want cute imitations
I know you wanted to save me
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on
Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know, I wanna know
When the memories pack up and leave, it will set me free
All those days on the beach will be washing away from me
I will keep you secretly just to keep the peace
Keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas

Do you remember when we moved out?
My mum said, "I love you, but it's a small house"
So we changed up and saved up
Gave up our town
We were dangerous, couldn't tame us
What's missing now?
Time (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Suddenly, we got no time (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're so busy doing life (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine
If you just focus on me
Like we were sixteen
And plotting our lives
Can I wear your t-shirt and sleep
On you while I dream
Of all the good times?
When we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen

You can worry 'bout this
You can worry 'bout that
You can worry 'bout she
You can worry 'bout this
You can worry 'bout that
You can worry 'bout she
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me
Lately, I don't think, I don't think about you, feelin' so free
Been jumpin' through hoops to get under you, but now I'm cool
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me
Been havin' good times
Been havin' late nights, yeah
And then you call me
Ask if I'm alright, what the hell?
Sayin' that you care about me
But you just wanna be in my head 'cause you're lonely
I thought I needed you to feel safe
But now that I've been through it, I'm stuck in a good place
Ooh, why you tryna put me in a different mood?
Just because I'm still not seein' someone new?

Painted to pure perfection
We had a real connection
Bodies aching, overtaken
You kept me at a distance
Not asking any questions
Fingers pressing, learning lessons
Beautiful lies on a Friday night
Starting to wonder where we lost the magic
Head in the clouds, talking so loud, all I hear is static
I'm not a material girl
Everything in your world just feels like plastic
Wearing your crown, it's pulling me down
You just want the power
You're not really down for love
You just want the power
No, I'm not chasing paper
And I'm not faking neither
Take me higher or this will expire
Your self obsessions boring
Sorry if I'm ignoring
Mindless actions lead to destruction

Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed
I bet you're still walkin' on a tightrope
Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho
You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know
It's a thin line between all this love and hate
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place
So, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
Yeah, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

Fire and ice
This love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
If we never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullet?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, a bullet?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay
Wouldn't put it like that
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming around
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without

Walk in your rainbow paradise
Strawberry lipstick state of mind
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Your wonder under summer skies
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you
Ooh, ooh

You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal"
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm
Matilda
, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up
You can see the world, following the seasons
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it
But I'm into it , I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your, it's none of your—"
It's New York, baby, always jacked up
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus
In a black dress,
she's such an actress

Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with it
I'm here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on my fingertips
And up to your mouth, I'm feelin' it out
I'm feelin' it now
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you t—
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that something, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are in
I mess around with him
And I'm okay with it

Coucou
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I confess
I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that
There's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?

Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror's staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh, I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

Ooh-oh
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit tied
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby, 'cause
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit (Check it)
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Wait a minute
You ready, JT?
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Hey, going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow! Burned myself, I just had to touch it
But it's so fire, and it's all mine
Hey, baby, and we don't mind all the watchin', ha
'Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn somethin'
She ain't nothin' but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight
And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swingin' in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh
Everyone knows
all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there
Everybody says, "Say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin'"
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have

I'm bringin' sexy back (Yeah)
Them other boys don't know how to act (Yeah)
I think it's special, what's behind your back? (Yeah)
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack (Yeah)
Take it to the bridge
c'mon
Dirty babe (Uh-huh)
You see these shackles, baby, I'm your slave (Uh-huh)
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave (Uh-huh)
It's just that no one makes me feel this way (Uh-huh)
Take it to the chorus
Come here, girl (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Come to the back (Go 'head, be gone with it)
VIP (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Drinks on me (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Let me see what you're twerkin' with
Go 'head, be gone with it
Look at those hips (Go 'head, be gone with it)
You make me smile (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Go 'head, child (Go 'head, be gone with it)
And get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on, ha (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on

I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine
Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon
So keep dancin'

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?
I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em,
let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

I was in Russia, then Germany, and…
Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it's free
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love, ayy
I want your drama, the touch of your hand (
Hey
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, your bad romance

Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Pay the toll to the angels
Drawing circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life
Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance,
now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night
"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na"
In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight"

It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital "H-I-M"
M, M, M, M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastico
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those
flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt
yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry
it don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I

Yeah
Turn the mic up
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that?
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching?
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
Watching reruns of
Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu?  Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

I have nightmares each week 'bout that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did
But I hold onto every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough
And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong
The arguments that I've won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone, and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

Lacy, oh Lacy, skin like puff pastry
Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell?
Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies
Did I ever tell you that I’m not doin' well?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time
Watching, hidden in plain sight
And ooh, I try, I try, I try
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere
The sweetest torture one could bear
Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin’ it lately
I feel your compliments likе bullets on skin
Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnatе
Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots
You got the one thing that I want
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
Try to rationalize, people are people
But it's like you're made of angel dust

One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?
I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

Double OT
I'm a new three
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', oh-ooh

Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band"
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend

Mm-mm
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mm
Yeah (Hey)
My mama called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations"
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it
Yeah, we made it
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like an addict, yeah
I'm surrounded by twenty bad bitch, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yeah
Everyone countin' on me drop the ball, yeah
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eye

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Needless to say, I keep a check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless

Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Needless to say, I'm keeping a check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

Ooh,
I fall apart
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah
She told me that I'm not enough
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh,
didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh woah
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh woah

Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin’ up
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin'
I know it piss you off to see me winnin'
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ , yeah
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Everywhere I go
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo
750 Lambo in the Utah snow
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared
Before I dropped
Stoney,
none of y'all really cared
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit
Used to have a lot, but I got more now
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least, that's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one-horse town,
I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
There's nothin' stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
And if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
But that's okay
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

It’s about what I was going through…
I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now, it's all too late, so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true
'Cause I know you
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Oh, oh

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, "Hey, by the way"

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said,
"Oh, my, my, my"
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Oh, yeah, oh
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say "hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break,
no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't
breathe
without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
You're not sorry

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and
endearing
And I'm comfortable

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now, you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it
rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
"We should be together"
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is, "Come closer"
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin' to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Mr. "Perfect face," Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right, Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"
But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
Mr. "Never told me why,"
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology, so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day, forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shinin' bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy
I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good-girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Looking at it now
Last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

Been sittin' eyes wide open
Behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like it's no point hopin' at all
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I'm sittin' eyes wide open
And I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wonderin' if I dodged a bullet
Or just lost the love of my life, oh

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Woah, woah)
I wanna be your end game, end game
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones too
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me
I'm one call away whenever you need me
I'm in a G5 , come to the A-Side
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I’d be the man
They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh , let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kinda guy the ladies want
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they’re right
You were outnumbered this time
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter,
your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the
tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say,
"I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world , have you heard?
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you , but I miss sparklin'

Meet me at midnight
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel
The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one-night or a wife

I-I-I-I
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I’ve been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
I-I-I-I
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what wе do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voicе is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an
endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the
effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you
but I touched you
And for a fortnight there,
we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask
about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned
into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there,
we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

So  long , London
So  long , London
So  long , London
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe
Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?"
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from
the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"
And who's gonna hold you like me?
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie,
in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

Seneler sürer her günüm
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Seneler sürer her günüm
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around, bring your friend with you
But we ain't really gonna sleep at all
You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures
In my city, I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous
She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby, I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin'
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private
, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like

I'ma care for you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you
You make it look like it's magic
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
And I'm so used to bein' used
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah
Girl, you earned it, yeah
You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful
And stay forever young
This I know, uh
This I know
She told me, "Don't worry
About it"
She told me, "Don't worry
No more"
We both know we can't go
Without it
She told me, "You'll never
Be alo-oh-oh-ooh"
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh

Ayy
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait?
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name?
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro
Ayy
Young Metro, young Metro
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now
I'm talkin'
Time
Rolling Stone
and
Bazaar
now 
Bazaar
now
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

Yeah
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty
No one's around to judge me
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

Thought I almost died in my dream again
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep
Without you, I can't sleep
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Ooh, yeah
I just pretend that I'm in the dark and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you

Ooh
Na-na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I saw the fire in your eyes
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes
You tell me things you wanna try
I know temptation is the devil in disguise
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice
You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light
It's like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says
Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to—

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfеct
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we'rе goin' through it (And it makes you feel alone)
Just know that I would die for you (Ooh, ooh)
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah
The distance and the time between us (Distance and the time)
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you (I would die for you)
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah

Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Tell nobody I control you
I broke you just to own you
They can't tell but I love you
'Cause you're loyal, baby
I love when you're submissive
You love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'
So say it
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kind of love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out
We don't gotta bе in love, no
I don't gotta be the onе, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh

I've seen the devil
Down Sunset
In every place
In every face
Yeah
Yeah
Tell me, do you see her?  She's livin' her life
Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight
But if you knew her , she lives a lie
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised
Oh, I know what she needs
She just want the fame, I know what shе fiends
Give hеr a little taste, runnin' back to me
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh
Ooh, every night , she prays to the sky
Flashin' lights is all she ever wants to see
Beggin' on her knees to be popular
That's her dream, to be popular
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular
Just to be popular
Everybody scream 'cause she popular
She mainstream 'cause she popular
Never be free 'cause she popular

Sun is shining, it's over
It's tomorrow
Bathe yourself in the light, in your love
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, no
Ever since I was a jit, knew I was the shit (Ooh, yeah)
Shawty keep wanna come 'round, she wanna get hit (Wanna get hit so hard)
She think she the main because I keep her by my side
Double-O, bust down the watch, she know that I'm timeless (Timeless)

Pockets hold twenty-two clips (I break her heart, Comme Garçon)
Put on a shirt, get put on a blimp
Bitch like a stain, get ready to lick
I had to tеll her that ever sincе I was a jit, knew I was the shit (She singin' my songs, she wanna die lit, tryna get hit)
House like a bank, deposit this bitch, 'posit that check
Smile on my face, ain't fearing shit, come and get checked (Ice on my neck, double-O wrist)
She in the Scat, hell of a 'Cat
Fresh out the trench, four hundred packs
Uh, yeah, I'm spinnin' in Paris (Dress for these hoes, they finna flock)
Just poured a four in a soda, it pop
Them drugs finna hit, I'm feelin' ill

Hoje eu vou dar pro novinho, fode, fode a larissinha

I surrender at your feet, baby, put it all on me
Every time I try to pray you away, you got me on my knees
I surrender at your feet, baby, put it all on me
I love it when you turn me on

So come back in and turn it on

Traffic dies while we are racin' home
Melted lights cover the open road
I hope we make it 'cause I've been chasin'
Another odyssey, oh
I can't wait to see your face
Crash when we're switchin' lanes
My love's beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake
We're dancin' in the flames
It's indescribable
Ooh, yeah
"The world can't heal," they say on the radio
So grab the wheel, want you to be in control
We're dodgin' headlights, and you say, "Hold tight"
Another odyssey, oh

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein
You know me (Know me, uh, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me
You know me

Yo!
What's sup?
Hey!
My name is Usher
You can trust there ain't
No punks in this house
And if U really wanna know what my name is!
Just Call Me A Mack
Word
Right!
Just call me the mack
Anytime baby
Cause I ain't confused!
I may be kinda young
But I got a whole lot of man in me
So I'm afraid
That I can't complain
I don't mind
If you wanna come by my crib
And chill
But just be sure
That you call me first
Because the last girl that tried
To just be droppin' on by
Learned how to play a player
And do you know why
Because the mack

This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how—
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me

Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
See, it's rare that you find people like us
'Cause all y'all other—
Out there doing what I'm doing
Or tryna do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh? Come on
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, "Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly?"
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it—
My way
My way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way
My way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

What you doing? Really?
You know I'm coming over, right?
Now, you got it hot for me already, baby?
Okay
Uh, give me ten minutes
Be ready
Hey, wear that little thing I like, yeah
It's seven o'clock on the dot
I'm in my drop top, cruising the streets, ah yeah
I got a real pretty, pretty little thing that's waiting for me
I pull up, anticipating
Good love, don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I never seen, girl, you know what I mean
Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt, ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow
See, I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be making love until the sun comes up, baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow

Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got somethin' to tell you
Listen
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See, this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you
But you remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
Thought that she was the one for me
'Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexin' everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone , hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh
Come on, that's how it's going down
You smell it? Hah, yeah
You smell it? Hah, yeah
Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh
Situations will arise
In our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
I loved you, you were my girl
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leaving, baby
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight

Peace up, A-Town down
Yeah
Okay
Usher, Usher
And Lil Jon
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's
Up in the club with my homies
Tryna get a little V-I, keep it down on the low-key
'Cause you know how it is (Hey, hey)
I saw this shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear, you would think that she know me
I decided to chill (Okay)
Conversation got heavy (Hey)
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
Watch out!
Watch out!
She was sayin', "Come get me"
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, "Baby, let's go" (Hey)
Let's go
When I told her, I said

Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time comin', but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn , let it burn , gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn , let it burn , gotta let it burn

Watch this
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call

It's the only way we know how to rock
Do you remember, girl?
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
'Cause I remember, girl
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
Girl, I was there when you were my baby
It started when we were younger, you were mine
Now, another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes
Even though we used to argue, it's alright
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide
And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feelin' for nothing
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon' hear me say

Yeah
Ursher, baby

Got all of these niggas, they crowdin' around you like they seen Beyoncé in here
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax
I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

Yeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
Am I your
fire?
Your one
desire
Yes, I know it's
too late
But I want it that way

Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright!
Hey-yeah, oh
Oh my God, we're back again
Brothers, sisters, everybody sing
Gonna bring the flavor, show you how
Got a question for you, better answer now, yeah
Am I original?
Yeah
Am I the only one?
Yeah
Am I sexual?
Yeah
Am I everything you need?
You better rock your body now
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright!
Alright!

As long as you love me
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Riskin' it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
Where you're from, what you did
As long as you love me
Who you are, where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

Baby, oh-oh
Even in my heart, I see
You're not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart
Before you tear us apart
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop
You're tearing us apart
Quit playing games with my heart
I live my life the way
To keep you coming back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see

I got mixed emotions
Did I finally find me a river
That could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love
That leaves you battered and broken
So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got
Am I being too open?
'Cause I told you everything I have to say
And now we're having a moment
Does it make you wanna pack up all your things
And drive away like you stole it?
Just forgive me if I'm being too open
No no no no, yeah yeah yeah

Hmm, mmmh, yeah, yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every
minute it makes me weaker
You can
save me from the man
That I've become, oh yeah
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is trying to call you
help me
I can't wait there's more, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If I was
thinkin' it makes me weaker
You can
save me
from the man
I've become
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's somethin' missin' in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car to get to you
I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
But my love is all
I have to give
Without you I don't
think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
When you talk
Does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave
When you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
Getting close to you, but here we are

Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Woo
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent
In flashes of light
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Lookin' at the crowd
And I see your body sway, come on
Wishin' I could thank you
In a different way, come on

You fill me up 'til you're empty
I took too much and you let me
We've been down all these roads before
And what we found don't live there anymore
It's dark, it's cold
If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold
Maybe you'd be happier with someone else
Maybe loving me's the reason you can't love yourself
Before I turn your heart into a ghost town
Show me everything we built so I can tear it all down
Down, down, down, down
You know I'll stay, don't you tempt mе
But all this weight is getting heavy
Been holding up what wasn't mеant to stand
I turned this love into a wasteland
It's dark, it's cold
If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold

Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces
Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got
Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you
Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

There's nothing colder than your shoulder
When you're dragging me along like you do, like you do
And then you switch up with no warnin'
And you kiss me like you want it, how rude, how rude
But I kinda like it anyways
I don't mind if this is gonna take a million days
I know you'll come around to me eventually
If you sit back, relax, and join my company, my company
Once you know what my love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right, you can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream, taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies, 'cause it feels so
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know
My love is so mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know
My little hard-to-get baby
I wanna give you the world
Not saying you gotta chase me
But I wouldn't mind it
If you gave me just a little bit
Of something we can work it with
But all you do is push me out

I'd never met you, but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're
In your head right now
While your world is spinning out
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me slow it down

Oh, I remember how you were
You were every shade of perfect
And then the colors blurred
And you'll never love me like you did
You'll never love, you'll never love me like you did
And I see your ghost from time to time
When I'm driving through the Rockies
And I feel this little knife in my heart
And it bleeds me out
Don't wanna love, I don't wanna love you now
Oh, how come all the best things fall apart?
And it startеd pretty slowly
Oh, when you asked about thе old me
"Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone?" Oh, I don't know
I think I left him somewhere I no longer go
And I watch you run away now
From all the lovely things we hate now
Where did we go? Where did we go? Oh, I don't know
But I know it feels like somewhere far away from home
And it's falling into pieces
No, there's not a way that we can stop this now
One thousand miles an hour, we're driving off the edge
And, darling, now there's nothing left
And it started out so slowly

Momma, I'm missing home
And California's getting colder
And colder, and colder
I miss you
And, Momma, I'm getting old
Does that mean you're getting older
And older, and older?
I miss you
Momma, don't you know
There's nothing to be sorry about?
I'm so proud of all you've done
Take me down your old street
Tell me your memories of when you were young and when you fell in love
Drive me through the country
Tell me your story and you can play all of your favorite songs
'Cause I'm gonna need this
When I'm holding pictures of you and that's all that I've got left
All that I've got left
All that I've got left
Lately, it's getting hard
I've started looking like my father
And it makes me cry a little bit
'Cause he really should've made it big
'Cause, damn, he's good at everything
And everything I am's because of you
I'm a man because of you

I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
But it's good to see your face
And I really hope you're doin' well
I hope you're doin' well
She was runnin' late for dinner, South side of town
Left the phone a little bitter, but it's cool for now
Far from perfect for each other, but we're workin' it out, I suppose
Now I'm waiting at the diner, looking traumatized
'Cause you walk up to the table with an order of fries
And I know ya, yes, I know ya, used to love you
And I said
I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
It's good to see your face
And I really hope you're doin' well
I hope you're doin' well
I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
I wish that I could stay
And talk at the bar all by ourselves
But I'm here for someone else

I tried to hide it through the silence while I played along
I'm welling up behind my eyelids when I'm holding on
To the rage, so badly I hate him
And I wish that all of—
Nah, nah, nah, that doesn't feel right
Maybe, uh, speed it up
Yeah, that's nice
I really hate the way you think that you can get away
By blaming all your stupid problems on your mental state
I'm tired of burnt-out lies, oh
Ooh
You think you know me, but you hardly even know yourself
I'd bite my tongue and let you think I only wish you well
I don't, I know you know it
Ooh
And I'm tired of letting someone get the bеst of me, so go ahead and
Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin somеone else's life
Cry, cry
Go bug somebody else, so I can sleep at night

He was a stranger
He walked in looking for danger
When he stares at you
He can chain you down and make you fall in love
Heaven knows, yeah
They made him out of fire and roses
With an attitude
But he's sweet enough to put him on your tongue
He can be everything you've ever dreamed
Ooh, Mr. Electric Blue
I wanna dance like you
How did you get so cool?
And, oh, you got electric soul
You lеt the good times roll
Mr. Electric Bluе
They say that he fell from space
Or some supernatural place
Mr. Electric Blue
I know I believe in you

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because
My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess, I still believe
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Mmm, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, baby
Oops, I did it again,
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
, oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love, that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
You see, my problem is this
I'm dreamin' away
Wishin' that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

Baby, can't you see I'm callin'?
A guy like you should wear a warnin'
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's gettin' late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's takin' over me

It's Britney, bitch
I see you
And I just wanna dance with you
Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room
We can get down
Like there's no one around
We keep on rocking
We keep on rocking
Cameras are flashing
While we're dirty dancing
They keep watching
Keep watching,
feels like the crowd is saying
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I'm Miss American Dream, since I was seventeen
Don't matter if I step on the scene, or sneak away to the Philippines
You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Miss Bad Media Karma
Another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in workin' and bein' a mama
And with a kid on my arm,
I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "Oh my God, that Britney's shameless"
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "Extra! Extra! This just in"
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "She's too big, now she's too thin"
You want a piece of me?

Superstar, where you from? How's it goin'?
I know you, got a clue what you're doin'
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you, gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
Womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
You got me goin'
You're oh-so-charmin'
But I can't do it
You womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
You say I'm crazy
I got your crazy
You're nothin' but a
Womanizer

One, two, three, not only you and me
Got one-eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Countin', one, two, three,
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Getting down with 3P
everybody loves—
Countin'
One, two, one-one-one-one, two, three
Countin', one, two, countin', one-one, two, three
Babe, pick a night to come out and play
If it's alright, what do you say?
Merrier the more, triple fun that way
Twister on the floor, what do you say?
Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing, yeah
Are you in?
I am countin'
One, two, three, not only you and me
Got one-eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Countin', one, two, three,
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves
Countin' one, two, three, not only you and me
Got one-eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Countin', one, two, three,
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves

Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said, "I want your body now"
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said, "I want your body now"
Would you hold it against me?
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out, 'cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it, you notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good-ish, sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waiting for?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out
Shame on me
To need release
Un-un-uncontrollably
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind, woah
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind, woah
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the bla-blanket
When the light's out

In this hard-hitting club smasher, Britney commands the wannabes to actually get to it, all while going Godzilla with her big bass.
You wanna?
You wanna?
You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
You want a Maserati? You better work, bitch
You want a Lamborghini? Sip martinis?
Look hot in a bikini?
You better work, bitch
You wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion?
Party in France?
You better work, bitch
You better work, bitch, you better work, bitch
You better work, bitch
Now get to work, bitch
Now get to work, bitch
Bring it on, ring the alarm
Don't stop now, just be the champion
Work it hard like it's your profession
Watch out now, 'cause here it comes

La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
Oh, baby, baby, have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom? Is she smoking up outside?
Oh, baby, baby, does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'ma buy her? Do you know just what she likes?
Oh, oh, tell me, have you seen her?
'Cause I'm so, oh, I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gon' go
Can somebody take me home?
Ha-ha, hee-hee, ha-ha, ho
Love me, hate me, say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la

Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time
I don't wanna be so shy, uh-oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

This is a story about a girl named Lucky
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say
"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

Tonight
I just wanna take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right
Players
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all tryna do?
24-karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Look out, uh
Pop-pop, it's show time , show time
Guess who's back again?
Oh, they don't know?  Oh, they don't know?
I bet they know as soon as we walk in
Wearin' Cuban links , designer minks
Inglewood's finest shoes
Don't look too hard, might hurt yourself
Known to give the color red the blues
Woo, shit
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
So many pretty girls around me and they wakin' up the rocket
Why you mad? Fix your face, ain't my fault they all be jockin'
Players only, come on

Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

Drop top Porsche , Rollie on my wrist
Diamonds up and down my chain
Cardi B, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook
My big fat ass got all them boys hooked
Went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands
Bruno sang to me while I do my money dance like
Ayy, flexin' on the 'Gram like
Ayy, hit the Lil Jon
Okay , okay
Oh, yeah, we drippin' in finesse and gettin' paid, ow
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight, I'm gonna show you off
When I walk in with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence or blame it on your measurements
Shut the shit down on sight
That's right

Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us, all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Ooh, I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
I'll unzip the back and watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door
'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing
Sayin', "There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of somethin' they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

One, two, one, two, three
Aw, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimmin' in your water's somethin' spiritual
I'm born again every time you spend the night, —ight
'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked outta heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked outta heaven
For too long
For too long

Oh-oh, oh, oh, ah
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have travelled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever
Exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay
Strollin' so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be

I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringin' me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singin' on my own
Now I can't find the key without you
And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
I'm sorry if it's all too much
Every day you're here, I'm healin'
And I was runnin' outta luck
I never thought I'd find this feelin'
'Cause I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless

Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration, foundation
A special bond of creation, ha
For all the single moms out there
Goin' through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean da Paul
Anne-Marie, sing, make them hear
She works the nights by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him
Daily struggle
She tells him, "Ooh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
Stay up there, stay up there
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gon' be nothin' like my life
Straight
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"
Stay up there, stay up there

I know you're out in Cabo
Hanging with your brother
Wishin' that I was your bottle
So I could be close to your lips again
I know you didn't call your parents
And tell 'em that we ended
'Cause you know that they'd be offended
Did you not want to tell 'em it's the end?
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So, I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Oh, I can't believe it, I
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I'm tryin' not to right now
You weren't a fan of pictures
So I hardly ever took 'em
Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom
So that way I can't forget your skin
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was

It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, e-e-e-everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you
It solo, solo, everybody
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool
It solo, solo, everybody
Since you've been gone
I've been dancin' on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause, baby, you're
The only one I'm comin' for
I can't take no more
No more, no more
I wanna f— , but I'm brokenhearted
Cry-cry-cry, but I like to party
Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f— , but I'm brokenhearted
Cry-cry-cry since the day we parted
Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

I tried hard to make you want me
But we're not supposed to be
And the truth will always haunt me
Even though it set me free
And my tears flow like the ocean
As they floated in the breeze
They were falling in slow motion
And they brought me to my knees
You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you
Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

Sé que te gusto a ti todavía
Tres, dos, uno
Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there, and my blood ran cold
Take me back to that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go
I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go
Find me in another place and time
If only, if only you were mine
But I'm already someone else's baby
Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's
C'mon
Baby, ah
Baby, ah
Baby, ah
I'm already someone else's

She works the nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come, she's got to save him
She tells him, "Oh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye
No, oh-oh
Rockabye

I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you
It solo, solo, everybody
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool
It solo, solo, everybody
Since you been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby, you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?
I see my body in a different light, ay ay ay
As if I woke up in a different life, ay ay ay
Feels like I'm walking with my heart on fire
Somebody pass me the water 'cause I'm burning
'Cause a little bit's turning into a lot
There's no way I'll be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought I was not
Tell me, tell me, ay ay ay
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?

I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from

J. Lo
to this
Headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real, I thought I told ya
I'm real even on
Oprah
That's just me
Nothing phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh

Love is life and life is living
It's very special
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Very special
Baby, don't go, uh
All my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
I understand, just chillin'
Baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
Why you actin' like that?
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreated me
And it's crazy, but oh, baby
Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hmm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together? I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
Wake up and rise and shine
Best get to work on time
No more playing video games
Things are about to change
We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hmm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together? I ain't your mama

If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?
Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, bae
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue, yeah
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

Oh, yeah
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Me plus you
Me plus you
One time; I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you
One time; I'ma tell you one time
One time
One time
When I met you, girl, my heart went knock, knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop, stop
And even though it's a struggle, love is all we got
So we gon' keep, keep climbing to the mountain top
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right
And girl, you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time
Girl, I love, girl, I love you
I'ma tell you one time
Girl, I love, girl, I love you
And I'ma be your one guy, you'll be my number one girl
Always makin' time for you
I'ma tell you one time
Girl, I love, girl, I love you
I'ma tell you one time
Girl, I love, girl, I love you

And we will never, ever, ever be apart (Yo, uh-huh)
Are we an item? (Yo) Girl, quit playin' (Uh-huh)
"We're just friends" (Yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)
Said, "There's another" (Yo), and looked right in my eyes (Uh-huh)
My first love broke my heart for the first time (Yo), and I was like (Uh-huh)
Baby, baby, baby, oh

Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I could take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby, take a chance, or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I don't know about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go
Tell me what you like, yeah, tell me what you don't
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I'ma make you shine bright, like you’re laying in the snow, burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind
Swaggy

As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now , you know, girl
We both know, it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, love me
As long as you love me, love me
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress , and don't cry
Oh, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take , my hand

Yeah
Young Money
Nicki Minaj
Justin, rrr
Show you off
Tonight, I wanna show you off

We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya
'Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all  'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
'Cause all—

What do you mean?  Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna  say no
What do you mean?  Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do  you mean? Oh,  what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time,  what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm sayin'
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complainin'
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night
First you're up, then you’re down, and then  between
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean? Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Hoppin' on the red-eye
Hoppin' on the red-eye
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent in your route
See you when I touch down
You're my champagne
You make me pop off everywhere like confetti
I know it seems strange
I seen you last night and I miss you already
My bed is depressed
My pillow's a victim
Got me in chills while my hands are sweaty (B-O-I)
And I gotta fly out (Ha)
Hate you got me strung-out (Ha)
And I gotta fly out (Hey)
Hate you got me strung-out, oh-ooh
Only been ten hours but my sanity is gone
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Ha)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag, oh, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Hey, big bag, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag, oh)

Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this
You encourage everyone without tryin'
All of your boundaries keep me in line
God is within us, what you're always sayin'
Your energy is enough to suffice
Your intentions are obvious
Your affection's miraculous
Every promise you make, you keep
Never met nobody else like this, only angels speak like this
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, la-di-da, la-di-da
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, di-da, la-da
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, di-da, da-da
Only angels speak like this

Had a dream, I was high
Holdin' on to the sky
But I heard your voice and stopped myself from fallin'
There'll be days, there'll be nights
When the stars don't align
And the sun can't even stop the rain from pourin'
So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go
'Cause all I know
This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what , no mattеr what
It's only us
Yeah, no matter what
Got you good, in the bag
Evеrything that I have
When the silence fills the air, just know I'm on it
When the waves start to crash
Like a fear from the past
Just remember that you're all I've ever wanted (Ever wanted)

Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
In the mornin' or the late
Say the word, on my way
Bona fide stallion
Ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run
Ain't on the side, you're number one
Yeah, every time I come around, you get it done
Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hundred racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS
Like a bitch, I would know
And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You don't really wanna stay, no
But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
’Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
I know it, I know it
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Ayy, yeah
Katy Perry, Migos, ayy
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby
Looks like you been starvin'
You got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cookin', boy
Let me take you
Under candlelight
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winnin'
lay 'em up like

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees (Yeah, yeah, undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek
What? What? What? (At us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent
now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ayy

Yeah, y'all know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy , your enemy
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no goin' back

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard with an open heart
How did I read the stars so wrong?
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see ain't always what it seems
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete
Fallin' from cloud nine
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
Well, those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
'Cause honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

Go for it
One, two
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek
They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, "Let's go out"
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Go back and tell it
Please, could you be tender?
And I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well, I guess I should go, yeah, I guess I should go
Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

Don't you think that it's
Boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again
Well, I'm bored
Because
I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasin' a million things I want
And I am
Only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showin' people how little we care
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah"
Pretty soon, I'll be getting
On my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city
Like they do in space
But my head's
Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm
Known?
And my
Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season, anyway
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feelin' low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old, o-old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
A-a-all we need is somebody to lean on

Bubble Butt is a single off Major Lazer’s Sophomore album “Free The Universe”. It features many artists like Tyga, Bruno Mars, Mystic Davis, and would later feature 2 Chainz.

Barbie
Yeah
They thought that you was a shy girl
Until I made you my girl
Girl you pushed me like a big button
'Til I cuffed you like you did somethin'
You ain't gotta wait for it
You ain't gotta wait for me to give you my love
You ain't gotta wait for it
Things are gettin' sticky, girl I think that I'm stuck
I'll admit I'm wrong when I know that you gon' come for me
When you gon' come for me, yeah
Never gonna not not hit that, your lovin' is drugs to me
When you gon' come to me, yeah
And every time you hit my phone, when you say you need company, oh

I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you


Yeah (Straight up)
Ooh
Wrist lookin' like it been dipped
Dipped in that, dipped in that, dipped in that
Script lookin' like it been flipped
Flippin' that, flippin' that, flippin' that (Yeah)
Pull up in that foreign, my God (Skrrt, skrrt)
Whole squad get in that, get in that
Please say it ain't true, I had to go and cop two
Hell nah, we can't fit in that
Wild ones, like we fresh out the cage
Showtime, baby, fresh off the stage
Bad lil' mama, fresh off the page
Front like you love
But you know that you hate it (Yeah, you hate it)
Yeah, you know no better
Yeah, you know no better (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, you know no better, ooh
Yeah, you know no better
Say you different, who you kidding?
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh, save that talk for the ones
Who don't know no better (Know no better)
'Cause, baby, I know you better ('Cause, baby, I know no better)
Baby, I know you better (Baby, I know)
Baby, I know you better

Yeah
Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee give in
What can I do to get the money?
We ain't got the money, we ain't getting out
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearing thin
All I need's relief
I need, I need some sympathy, yeah
Look at me
I just can't believe what they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
Look at me
I just can't believe what they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream
All of my life been wading in
Water so deep, now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long, how long 'til we have a friend?
Coming down, feeling like a battery hen
Waves won't break 'til the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise?
What will I do without my dreams?

Onazo, yeah
Onazo
They told me everybody's 15 minutes in a different timezone
And since I have it at the moment, you the one I wanna shine my light on
Get your life, get your life, little mama, won't you get your life on?
Ain't nothing cooler than the wrong moves, when you do 'em to the right song, the right song
Let's shoot this movie and put the shit on repeat
I hope this Mary's not making you fall asleep
Before we hit the road, put our phones on silent
Nobody's tryna bring sand to the beach
What would it take to change your plans for the weekend?
'Cause I am tryna kick it like EA
The whole thing, the pre-party, the pre-sex
Now we hit the Major League where the G's at
I like you, girl, in particula
You in particula
Sey I like your waist in particula, ah ha, eh
I like you, girl, in particula, yeah
You in particula
Sey I like your waist in particula, ah ha, eh

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me

We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A

The truth is bulletproof, there's no foolin' you
I don't dress the same
Me and who you say I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
'Cause that's for chasin' cars
Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts
And goin' way too far
I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'causе I
used to be young
Take onе, pour it out, it's not worth cryin' 'bout
The things you can't erase
Like tattoos and regrets,
words I never meant
And ones that got away
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
And took another road
Turns out crowded rooms empty out as soon
There's somewhere else to go, oh-oh

It's our party, we can do what we want (Ear Drummers, ooh)
It's our party, we can say what we want (Mike WILL Made-It, ooh)
It's our party, we can love who we want (Ooh)
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want (Ayy)
It's our party, we can do what we want (Ooh)
It's our party, we can say what we want (Ooh)
It's our party, we can love who we want (Ooh)
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want (Right about now, ayy)
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "hell no"?
'Cause we gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party
Dancin' with Molly
Doin' whatever we want
This is our house, this is our rules

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away



Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah, Rihanna)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Good Girl Gone Bad)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Comin' down with the Dow Jones (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
When the clouds come, we go, we Roc-A-Fella (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me (You know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at? (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said "I'll always be your friend"
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standin' side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go-ooh-oh

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
[Verse 2: Kanye West &
Paul McCartney
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz
Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want

Yayo, yayo
Mula-la
Yayo
Bitch better have my money
Y'all should know me well enough

Ballin' bigger than LeBron

Don't act like you forgot

Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Pay me what you owe me

Breathe out, breathe in

American, American oxygen
American oxygen, woah
Breathe in this feeling

Oh, say can you see

Young girl, hustlin'
On the other side of the ocean
You can be anything at all
In America, America

Just close your eyes and breathe
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been, mm
But I wake up and act like nothing's wrong
Just get ready fi work, work, work, work, work, work
He said me haffi work, work, work, work, work, work

Before the tables turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

And you got me like, oh
What you want from me? (What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby, you got me like, oh, mmm
You love when I fall apart (Fall apart)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall
Baby, you got me like, I, woo, I
Don't you stop loving me (Loving me)
Don't quit loving me (Loving me)
Just start loving me, oh (Loving me)
And, babe, I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something, babe?
And I'll run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way (Feeling this way)
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (Cursing my name)
No matter what I do, I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain

Mustard on the beat, ho!
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
So, when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take "no"
I love it when you do what you want 'cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we out late
We don't care what them people say
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So, baby, be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot, it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So, baby, be the life of the party
Together, we can just let go
Pretending like there's no one else here that we know
Slow dance, fall in love as the club track plays
We don't care what them people say

I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left
seein' red
on my own

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off, but I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time in this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mmm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mmm
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying, baby
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy?
Mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy?
Mercy on my heart
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride is all I got
I'm saying, baby

I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessin', yeah
Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better
Does it ever?
Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
Oh, I gotta ask
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name
, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah
I love it when you call
señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you know I love it when you call
señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah
But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool
, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up , liftin' me up
And tearin' me down , tearin' me down
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one

I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I'll forget about them
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by
I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder, I wonder

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anythin', when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down
I'm the one for a good time call
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, I feel the love
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly
Like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
But I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight, on for tonight

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long

Uh-oh, runnin' out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, I need another lover, be mine
'Cause I, I, I got stamina
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no, no, no
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no, no, no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Well, uh-oh, runnin' out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, runnin' now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
And oh yeah, runnin' through the waves of love
But I, I got stamina
And oh yeah, I'm runnin' and I've just enough
And uh-oh, I got stamina

Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me
Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling?
If you can't catch me, darling
Don't cry, snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
Can't hold me close, baby
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on, let's go
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, baby
My snowman and me,
My snowman and me
Baby
Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey?
Without legs to run, honey
Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby?
If you don't have ears, baby

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh

I took a page out of your favorite book
You sold me lies just by the way you look
Taught me a language that I'd never speak
Baby, that ain't for me, that, that ain't for me
I dug my grave watchin' the way you move
You took me higher than I ever flew, ooh
Too many times, gave you a second chance
Baby, I'm just a man, I'm, I'm just a man
No more thinkin' about you late night
No more runnin' around with your friends and I'm
Done pickin' the pieces of my
Soul up off the floor, oh, oh
I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willin'
But tonight, I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't wanna lose you, baby
But I can't play this gamе no more
I thought it would kill me
But tonight, I saved my lifе when I showed you the door

Sun is going down, time is running out
No one else around but me
Steady losing light, steady losing my mind
Moving shadows and grinding teeth
Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I'd do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you, I keep
Slipping into bad dreams
Where there's no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these
Bad dreams
Waitin' on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these, all of these
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bad dreams
Ooh, ooh, ooh
All of these

Are you even real
Or did I make you up?
How could someone like you
Wanna give me love?
Don't think I deserve you
But I can't get enough
You're so beautiful, spiritual
More like a miracle
Part of me's scared that you
Might be invisible
Too good to be true
Tell me
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Made up in my head, or are you in my bedroom?
Questions that I ask ever since I met you
Tеll me
Are you , arе you
Are you, are you
Somethin' from a dream or somethin' that I made up?
Questions that I ask every time that I wake up

No, woah
I woke up this morning kinda mad
Flipped a switch, I had the urge to beat your ass
Mm-mm
Turnin' up you in a different state
You fucked it up with me all kinds of ways, I'm mad
Boy, I'm so mad
You wanna tell me it was nothing
Why don't you tell me I'm a fool?
Say you're sorry 'bout it
I would be, too
I got no mercy
You don't deserve me, no
And you might be hurtin'
But damn it, you hurt me, boy
So I'll watch you suffer
Crawl back to me on broken glass
And you better love her
Regret will drive a person mad
I got no mercy
That shit was dirty
Dirty, dirty, dirty

Walking down the street last night
Watching strangers pass me by
Where do all our shadows go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know
I can fool my senses for a little while
But some things are too hard to reconcile
When I look into your eyes
There's no answers I can't find
It's a feeling that I've never known
And, when I'm wide awake tonight
Running circles in my mind
There's an answer I can't find
When did your heart let me go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know
I guess, somе things, I'll never know
I'm running out of avenuеs
'Cause every road leads back to you
When memories fade, where do they go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know


Of havin' only eyes for you
Of letting you turn my crimson skies blue, ooh
Of hatin' your somebody new
Of gettin' hella jealous of the ground that's under you, ooh
Of goin' way too hard
Or tryna call you while I'm stormin' out the bar
Of goin' way across the line
Of needin' you at the end of every night
I'm guilty, baby
I'm guilty, baby
If havin' a bleeding heart is a crime
If lovin' you means I'm servin' life
I'm guilty, baby
Of usin' medicine as a crutch
On the nights when the voices in my head won't shut up (Oh)
Of goin' way (Of goin' way) too far (Too far)
Or drivin' by your place and countin' up the cars (Up the cars)
Of goin' way (Of goin' way) across the line (Across the line)
Of needin' you at the end of every night

God went crazy when He painted you
Ain't seen nothin' like this before, mm
Took a little extra time on you
Before He let you walk out the door
You got that smile, babe
You got that subtle Mona Lisa, drive me wild, babe
I'd give it all up just to keep you by my side, babe
I knew it from the jump
Fit right in my arms like you the one
Yeah, I'm made for you
I prayed for you
There's a light in your eyes every color in the sky
Don't come close to
Yеah, I'm made for you
I prayed for you
Swear that God wеnt crazy when He painted you
Ooh
Ooh

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home,
you're like a dream come true
But, if by chance, you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie, you sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together at Skyfall
At Skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Just the guitar, okay, cool
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me, mmm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me, mmm
That was what you told me
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I built a house for a love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears
But, oh my
Oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Tryna learn to lean into it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right

You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
You crossed the line and it's time to say "F you"
What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try
staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope
but I still
can't let you go

We're not in love
We share no stories
Just somethin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side
Fall into the dark side
Give in to the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side

I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment before I go, it's nothing personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand
So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
Blep, yah, yah
Farru
Yah-yah-yah-yah

Hello, sweet grief
I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the mornin' after ecstasy
I am drownin' in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doin' everything I can
To make sure I never love again
I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

We were young, posters on the wall
Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
We would stare at each other
'Cause we were always in trouble
And all the cool kids did their own thing
I was on the outside always looking in
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
They never really cared if I wasn't
We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
Then I saw your face, your forgiving eyes
Looking back at me from the other side
Like you understood me
And I'm never letting you go, oh

Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away

Woah
Eyes up, you've been gone for a fortnight
My love, are you stuck in a fake life?
Can't win, if the prize is to waste your time
Now it's wasting mine
And I know that we're close, but I'm lonely
Make me your only, won't win a trophy
But can it kiss you like this when you hold me?
Missing it lowkey, I'll say it slowly
It's me or the PS5
Tell me how you wanna spend your night
Three's feeling way too tight
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
Me or the PS5
Tell me which of us is more your type
Seems like you can't decide
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
Oh-oh

I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Cold hands, red eyes
Packed two bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
Y-y-y-you think you're so small like you're itty-bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walkin' by strangers on the side of the street
Like a quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of m-m-m-mind, like
Like it's just a waste of time, like-like-like
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world

Hey
I know what I came to do
And that ain't gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
'Cause I won't take the bait
I'm over here doin' what I like
I'm over here workin' day and night
And if my real ain't real enough
I'm sorry for you, babe
Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holdin' us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me (Focus),
f-f-focus on me, woo (Focus on me)
Focus on me (Focus),
f-f-focus on me, woo (Focus on me)
I can tell you're curious
It's written on your lips
Ain't no need to hold it back
Go 'head and talk your shit
I know you're hopin' that I'll react
I know you're hopin' I'm lookin' back
But if my real ain't real enough
Then I don't know what is

Oh, yeah
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'—

You got me some type of way
Ain't used to feelin' this way
I do not know what to say
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face
Now I wanna know how you taste
Usually don't give it away
But you know I'm already thinkin' 'bout it
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"
Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin'
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right, but I don't care
Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
This shit always happen to me
Why can't we just play for keeps?
Practically on my knees
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you already thinkin' 'bout it

Mmm
Hey, yeah
I'm stuck with you
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby

I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothin' at all
It's comin' down on me
Water like misery
It's comin' down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain on me
Mm, oh yeah, baby
Rain on me
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try, mm
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah

Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hopin’ I don't repeat history
Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday
Never need no , no one else, babe
’Cause I'll be
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do
That I won't do, switchin’ for you
Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true
But I get tired of runnin', fuck it
Now, I’m runnin' with you
Said, boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday
Never need no , no onе else, babe
'Causе I'll be

In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on
Come on and walk this way through the fire
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like
"Yes, and?"
Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "What's next?"
"Yes, and?"
Now, I'm so done with caring
What you think, no, I won't hide
Underneath your own projections
Or change my most authentic life

You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman
I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it
And I can be all the things you told me not to be
When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
And he see the universe when I'm the company
It's all in me

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side
I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I—
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side

Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin' , I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up , pickin' it up
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but, boy, I like it
I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We out here vibin'
We vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now
Can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah

Hmm
You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been cravin'
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies
So what you doin' tonight?
Better say, "Doin' you right"
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight
I don't wanna keep you up
But show me, can you keep it up?
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy
I've been drinkin' coffee
And I've been eatin' healthy
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah
Savin' up my energy
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm
Sometimes, it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better 'cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you
So, one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should've been more careful

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
She'll pity the men I know

I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
mm-mm

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on
Survivor
just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

Oh, mm-mm
I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh
"Call me when you're there"
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'"
So now, she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair
Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change , you could borrow
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby
Birds of a feather, we should stick together
, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
I said you
You were the love of my life
The love of my life
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you
Then you tried to break mine
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me
Then you moved on immediately
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
When I said you
You  were the love of my life
The love of my life

Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
Hmm
Well, good things don't last
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
f "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

Billie,
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
She'll pity the men I know

I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
mm-mm

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on
Survivor
just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic

I used to float, now I just fall down

It's a craving, not a crush, huh
"Call me when you're there"
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'"
So now, she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair
Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name

I might, I might
Empty my bank account

Buy that boy with a pipe
I might
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms
Layin', we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde, huh
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Hey!
Now nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe
And do you mind if I steal a kiss?
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here
Just wanna feel it from you
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

Ah-ooh, ooh, ah-ooh
I want you to breathe me in
Let me be your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition, no fear
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?
Hit me harder again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer again
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh

Are you drunk enough
Not to judge what I'm doin’?
Are you high enough
To excuse that I'm ruined? 'Cause I’m ruined
Is it late enough
For you to come and stay over?
'Cause we're free to love
So tease me, ooh
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything (Tonight)
I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (Tonight)
Magic is in the air, there ain’t no science here
So come get your everything (Tonight)
Tonight
Your everything tonight, uh
Is it loud enough?
’Cause my body is callin' for ya, callin’ for ya
I need someone
To do the things that I do, mhm
I'm heatin' up
Energy's takin’ control
I'm speedin' up
My heartbeat's dancin' alone

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
Summer

I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
Got L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci
Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
We deserve Grammys and some Oscars, damn
They deserve Whammys, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way
We say nothin' more than we need
I say, "Your place" when we leave
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothin' left
Hey, I've been wantin' to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you cryin'
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
ay
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' 'ery girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, a—
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had , best I ever had
Best I ever had , best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there
Yup
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Welcome
To the future, uhh (Blueprint, 3, ay-ay, oh, hey-hey)
Hey, count me in (Blue-print, 3, ay, hey, hey-hey)

Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me

Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Everybody get your mothafuckin' roll on

Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First-last, phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo

Alright!
It's a short life, yeah

D. Hill
D. Hill
Ayy
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

Yeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
"Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"
June, you're a genius
I said, "I respect it, no problem"
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man
trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends
snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you
mad
at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn, coach, put him in"
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah

Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife

Black leather glove, no sequins
Buckles on the jacket, it's Alyx shit
Nike crossbody, got a piece in it

I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star-struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no, we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again
Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up

You still ain't did shit about the other one

And they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 a.m. to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
God's plan, God's plan

KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
TrapMoneyBenny, ayy

From the block like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many

Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need, my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Baby, I like your style

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home
Home
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver, 40, Niko shit man
15 Fort York shit, y'know?
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes

Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
You're not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone
Oh, but when you're gone, when you're gone, when you're gone
Oh, baby, all the lights go out
Thinking now that maybe I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
Oh, baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you, do for you, do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock
He can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You'd probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving till late in the night
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, oh, same me
Inside
If you don't like the way I talk
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock
Then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue
You'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

One
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Something in you-ou-ou
Lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

If you don't wanna see me
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Bad Bunny
You know that sometimes I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Eh-eh
Pero contigo es todo o na'
-eh
Yeah-yeah
You're deep in the water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now, but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

If you wanna
run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we
fell into
a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv makin' dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbin' if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothin' but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal 'cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's gettin' dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities stickin' their noses in
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

It's late in the evenin', glass on the side
I've been sat with you for most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Louder
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Na-na-na-na
Mmm
I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Ooh, ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

Build the fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas
We'll
dance in the kitchen
while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bеautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas
The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

I met her smokin' a cigarette in a toilet cubicle
Red  dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful
This  ain't the time or place to start a future, but, darlin', I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere
Well, darlin', here we go again
We  are only man and woman and we all make mistakes
"Don't  you know we're only human?", is what I heard you say
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain
'Cause  I have felt the same, no
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh,  can you see the love in mine?
She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls
Well, darlin', here we go again
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are
And I could put you back together when you come apart
And we should make a start now, oh

It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth
Why am I feelin' so nervous when
Things are goin' so perfect? And
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you

I will remember you
In the way you'd want me to
But it's hard to come to terms right now
Sunset looked today
As if it knew you'd gone away
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down
Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain
Oh, I could be a shoulder, not a burden
And it's time for me to call your son again
And say
She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away
I will remember you
With white wine by the barbecue
On New York at the birthday do, downtown
All that comes to mind
When I think about the time
Is a memory of laughin' out loud

Welcome to the world
I heard your heart beat and lost every word
Just stood there quietly taking in the sound
Of our love
This is gonna hurt
But I'll stand beside you, for better or for worse
And I will find you whenever you're lost
I'll be right here
And ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away
Welcome to the world
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt
Don't let them change you, words are only words
Just like I loved you
And yes, you were the first
A new beginning, bright and unreserved
A beautiful red flower in the earth
Will grow, and I know

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't brеak my boat
The stones crash on the boardwalk
Thе wind rush through the trees
I keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been
Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight"
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get-well-soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But, Mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it, too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you?

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a handprint on the door
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before
This is our luck, baby, running out
Our clothes were never off
We still have our roads to run about
To scale the map, to scale the map to get us back on track
I've seen you in a fight you lost
I've seen you in a fight
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys

Oh, oh, starry-eyed
Hip, oh, sta-a-a-a—
Oh, oh, deye-yrrats
​swolg ydobyrevE, starry-eyed
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning
Handlebars that I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in and I'll throw out my heart and get a new one
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning, ah
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah
Woah, oh, oh
So we burst into colours, colours and carousels
Fall head first like paper planes and playground games

I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
Noises
I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathin'
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world
If I was a sculptor, but, then again, no
Or a girl who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

Stripped to the waist, we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over
Yes, since we found out, since we found out
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could
After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its colour
But now I've seen it through and now I know the truth
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could

We don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race
When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shinin' up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We were lovers for the first time
Running all the red lights
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah
We were sipping on emotions
Smoking and inhaling every moment
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah
We were high and we were sober
We were on and we were over
We were young and now I'm older
But I'd do it all again
Getting drunk on a train track
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes
Ten dollars was a fat stack
I'd do it all again
Bomber jacket and a snapback
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach
"Re: Stacks" on the playback
I'd do it all again
We were lovers on a wild ride
Speeding for the finish line
Come until the end of our time, yeah
Started off as a wildfire
Burning down the bridges to our empire
Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah

You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin
Is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both hate everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me (Woo)
You can never come too close for comfort
I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn
I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover
And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber
Iced out body, didn't go to college
Price tag poppin', then you on a private
Don't say sorry, everyone's watchin'
When you're where I am, everything's timeless

Remember me in a simple way, not what I did or said
When I think of you now, I just think of the day we met
Don't forget me, like I didn't care
Yeah, I stole from myself just to make you complete
I don't think you have the patience
I don't think you know the difference
And I don't want cute imitations
I know you wanted to save me
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on
Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know, I wanna know
When the memories pack up and leave, it will set me free
All those days on the beach will be washing away from me
I will keep you secretly just to keep the peace
Keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas

Do you remember when we moved out?
My mum said, "I love you, but it's a small house"
So we changed up and saved up
Gave up our town
We were dangerous, couldn't tame us
What's missing now?
Time (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Suddenly, we got no time (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're so busy doing life (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine
If you just focus on me
Like we were sixteen
And plotting our lives
Can I wear your t-shirt and sleep
On you while I dream
Of all the good times?
When we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen

You can worry 'bout this
You can worry 'bout that
You can worry 'bout she
You can worry 'bout this
You can worry 'bout that
You can worry 'bout she
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me
Lately, I don't think, I don't think about you, feelin' so free
Been jumpin' through hoops to get under you, but now I'm cool
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me
Been havin' good times
Been havin' late nights, yeah
And then you call me
Ask if I'm alright, what the hell?
Sayin' that you care about me
But you just wanna be in my head 'cause you're lonely
I thought I needed you to feel safe
But now that I've been through it, I'm stuck in a good place
Ooh, why you tryna put me in a different mood?
Just because I'm still not seein' someone new?

Painted to pure perfection
We had a real connection
Bodies aching, overtaken
You kept me at a distance
Not asking any questions
Fingers pressing, learning lessons
Beautiful lies on a Friday night
Starting to wonder where we lost the magic
Head in the clouds, talking so loud, all I hear is static
I'm not a material girl
Everything in your world just feels like plastic
Wearing your crown, it's pulling me down
You just want the power
You're not really down for love
You just want the power
No, I'm not chasing paper
And I'm not faking neither
Take me higher or this will expire
Your self obsessions boring
Sorry if I'm ignoring
Mindless actions lead to destruction

Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed
I bet you're still walkin' on a tightrope
Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho
You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know
It's a thin line between all this love and hate
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place
So, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
Yeah, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

Fire and ice
This love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
If we never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullet?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, a bullet?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay
Wouldn't put it like that
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming around
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without

Walk in your rainbow paradise
Strawberry lipstick state of mind
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Your wonder under summer skies
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you
Ooh, ooh

You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal"
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm
Matilda
, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up
You can see the world, following the seasons
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it
But I'm into it , I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your, it's none of your—"
It's New York, baby, always jacked up
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus
In a black dress,
she's such an actress

Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with it
I'm here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on my fingertips
And up to your mouth, I'm feelin' it out
I'm feelin' it now
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you t—
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that something, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are in
I mess around with him
And I'm okay with it

Coucou
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I confess
I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that
There's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?

Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror's staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh, I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

Ooh-oh
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit tied
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby, 'cause
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit (Check it)
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Wait a minute
You ready, JT?
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Hey, going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow! Burned myself, I just had to touch it
But it's so fire, and it's all mine
Hey, baby, and we don't mind all the watchin', ha
'Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn somethin'
She ain't nothin' but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight
And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swingin' in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh
Everyone knows
all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there
Everybody says, "Say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin'"
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have

I'm bringin' sexy back (Yeah)
Them other boys don't know how to act (Yeah)
I think it's special, what's behind your back? (Yeah)
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack (Yeah)
Take it to the bridge
c'mon
Dirty babe (Uh-huh)
You see these shackles, baby, I'm your slave (Uh-huh)
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave (Uh-huh)
It's just that no one makes me feel this way (Uh-huh)
Take it to the chorus
Come here, girl (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Come to the back (Go 'head, be gone with it)
VIP (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Drinks on me (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Let me see what you're twerkin' with
Go 'head, be gone with it
Look at those hips (Go 'head, be gone with it)
You make me smile (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Go 'head, child (Go 'head, be gone with it)
And get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on, ha (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)
Get your sexy on

I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine
Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon
So keep dancin'

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?
I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em,
let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

I was in Russia, then Germany, and…
Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it's free
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love, ayy
I want your drama, the touch of your hand (
Hey
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, your bad romance

Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Pay the toll to the angels
Drawing circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life
Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance,
now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night
"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na"
In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight"

It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital "H-I-M"
M, M, M, M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastico
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those
flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt
yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry
it don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I

Yeah
Turn the mic up
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that?
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching?
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
Watching reruns of
Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu?  Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

I have nightmares each week 'bout that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did
But I hold onto every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough
And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong
The arguments that I've won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone, and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

Lacy, oh Lacy, skin like puff pastry
Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell?
Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies
Did I ever tell you that I’m not doin' well?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time
Watching, hidden in plain sight
And ooh, I try, I try, I try
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere
The sweetest torture one could bear
Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin’ it lately
I feel your compliments likе bullets on skin
Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnatе
Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots
You got the one thing that I want
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
Try to rationalize, people are people
But it's like you're made of angel dust

One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?
I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

Double OT
I'm a new three
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', oh-ooh
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you

Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott"
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band"
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend

Mm-mm
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mm
Yeah (Hey)
My mama called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations"
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it
Yeah, we made it
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like an addict, yeah
I'm surrounded by twenty bad bitch, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yeah
Everyone countin' on me drop the ball, yeah
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eye

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Needless to say, I keep a check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Needless to say, I'm keeping a check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

Ooh,
I fall apart
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah
She told me that I'm not enough
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh,
didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh woah
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh woah

Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin’ up
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin'
I know it piss you off to see me winnin'
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ , yeah
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Everywhere I go
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo
750 Lambo in the Utah snow
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared
Before I dropped
Stoney,
none of y'all really cared
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit
Used to have a lot, but I got more now
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least, that's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one-horse town,
I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
There's nothin' stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
And if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
But that's okay
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

It’s about what I was going through…
I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now, it's all too late, so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true
'Cause I know you
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Oh, oh

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, "Hey, by the way"

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said,
"Oh, my, my, my"
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Oh, yeah, oh
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say "hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break,
no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't
breathe
without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
You're not sorry

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and
endearing
And I'm comfortable

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now, you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it
rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
"We should be together"
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is, "Come closer"
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin' to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Mr. "Perfect face," Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right, Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"
But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
Mr. "Never told me why,"
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology, so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day, forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shinin' bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy
I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good-girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Looking at it now
Last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

Been sittin' eyes wide open
Behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like it's no point hopin' at all
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I'm sittin' eyes wide open
And I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wonderin' if I dodged a bullet
Or just lost the love of my life, oh

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Woah, woah)
I wanna be your end game, end game
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones too
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me
I'm one call away whenever you need me
I'm in a G5 , come to the A-Side
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I’d be the man
They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh , let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kinda guy the ladies want
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they’re right
You were outnumbered this time
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter,
your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the
tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say,
"I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world , have you heard?
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you , but I miss sparklin'

Meet me at midnight
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel
The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one-night or a wife

I-I-I-I
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I’ve been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
I-I-I-I
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what wе do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voicе is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an
endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the
effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you
but I touched you
And for a fortnight there,
we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask
about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned
into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there,
we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

So  long , London
So  long , London
So  long , London
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe
Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?"
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from
the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"
And who's gonna hold you like me?
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie,
in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

Seneler sürer her günüm
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Seneler sürer her günüm
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around, bring your friend with you
But we ain't really gonna sleep at all
You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures
In my city, I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous
She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby, I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin'
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private
, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like

I'ma care for you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you
You make it look like it's magic
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
And I'm so used to bein' used
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah
Girl, you earned it, yeah
You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful
And stay forever young
This I know, uh
This I know
She told me, "Don't worry
About it"
She told me, "Don't worry
No more"
We both know we can't go
Without it
She told me, "You'll never
Be alo-oh-oh-ooh"
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh

Ayy
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait?
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name?
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro
Ayy
Young Metro, young Metro
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now
I'm talkin'
Time
Rolling Stone
and
Bazaar
now 
Bazaar
now
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

Yeah
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty
No one's around to judge me
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

Thought I almost died in my dream again
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep
Without you, I can't sleep
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Ooh, yeah
I just pretend that I'm in the dark and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you

Ooh
Na-na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I saw the fire in your eyes
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes
You tell me things you wanna try
I know temptation is the devil in disguise
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice
You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light
It's like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says
Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to—

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfеct
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we'rе goin' through it (And it makes you feel alone)
Just know that I would die for you (Ooh, ooh)
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah
The distance and the time between us (Distance and the time)
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you (I would die for you)
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah

Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Tell nobody I control you
I broke you just to own you
They can't tell but I love you
'Cause you're loyal, baby
I love when you're submissive
You love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'
So say it
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kind of love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out
We don't gotta bе in love, no
I don't gotta be the onе, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh

I've seen the devil
Down Sunset
In every place
In every face
Yeah
Yeah
Tell me, do you see her?  She's livin' her life
Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight
But if you knew her , she lives a lie
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised
Oh, I know what she needs
She just want the fame, I know what shе fiends
Give hеr a little taste, runnin' back to me
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh
Ooh, every night , she prays to the sky
Flashin' lights is all she ever wants to see
Beggin' on her knees to be popular
That's her dream, to be popular
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular
Just to be popular
Everybody scream 'cause she popular
She mainstream 'cause she popular
Never be free 'cause she popular

Sun is shining, it's over
It's tomorrow
Bathe yourself in the light, in your love
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, no
Ever since I was a jit, knew I was the shit (Ooh, yeah)
Shawty keep wanna come 'round, she wanna get hit (Wanna get hit so hard)
She think she the main because I keep her by my side
Double-O, bust down the watch, she know that I'm timeless (Timeless)

Pockets hold twenty-two clips (I break her heart, Comme Garçon)
Put on a shirt, get put on a blimp
Bitch like a stain, get ready to lick
I had to tеll her that ever sincе I was a jit, knew I was the shit (She singin' my songs, she wanna die lit, tryna get hit)
House like a bank, deposit this bitch, 'posit that check
Smile on my face, ain't fearing shit, come and get checked (Ice on my neck, double-O wrist)
She in the Scat, hell of a 'Cat
Fresh out the trench, four hundred packs
Uh, yeah, I'm spinnin' in Paris (Dress for these hoes, they finna flock)
Just poured a four in a soda, it pop
Them drugs finna hit, I'm feelin' ill

Bota na boca, bota na cara, bota onde quiser

Hoje eu vou dar pro novinho, fode, fode a larissinha

I surrender at your feet, baby, put it all on me
Every time I try to pray you away, you got me on my knees
I surrender at your feet, baby, put it all on me
I love it when you turn me on
I love it when you turn it on

So come back in and turn it on
Bota na boca, bota na cara, bota onde quiser (Turn me on)

Hoje eu vou dar pro novinho, fode, fode a larissinha (Turn me on)

Traffic dies while we are racin' home
Melted lights cover the open road
I hope we make it 'cause I've been chasin'
Another odyssey, oh
I can't wait to see your face
Crash when we're switchin' lanes
My love's beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake
We're dancin' in the flames
It's indescribable
Ooh, yeah
"The world can't heal," they say on the radio
So grab the wheel, want you to be in control
We're dodgin' headlights, and you say, "Hold tight"
Another odyssey, oh

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein
You know me (Know me, uh, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me
You know me

Yo!
What's sup?
Hey!
My name is Usher
You can trust there ain't
No punks in this house
And if U really wanna know what my name is!
Just Call Me A Mack
Word
Right!
Just call me the mack
Anytime baby
Cause I ain't confused!
I may be kinda young
But I got a whole lot of man in me
So I'm afraid
That I can't complain
I don't mind
If you wanna come by my crib
And chill
But just be sure
That you call me first
Because the last girl that tried
To just be droppin' on by
Learned how to play a player
And do you know why
Because the mack

This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how—
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me

Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
See, it's rare that you find people like us
'Cause all y'all other—
Out there doing what I'm doing
Or tryna do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh? Come on
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, "Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly?"
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it—
My way
My way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way
My way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

What you doing? Really?
You know I'm coming over, right?
Now, you got it hot for me already, baby?
Okay
Uh, give me ten minutes
Be ready
Hey, wear that little thing I like, yeah
It's seven o'clock on the dot
I'm in my drop top, cruising the streets, ah yeah
I got a real pretty, pretty little thing that's waiting for me
I pull up, anticipating
Good love, don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I never seen, girl, you know what I mean
Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt, ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow
See, I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be making love until the sun comes up, baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow

Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got somethin' to tell you
Listen
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See, this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you
But you remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
Thought that she was the one for me
'Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexin' everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone , hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh
Come on, that's how it's going down
You smell it? Hah, yeah
You smell it? Hah, yeah
Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh
Situations will arise
In our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
I loved you, you were my girl
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leaving, baby
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight

Peace up, A-Town down
Yeah
Okay
Usher, Usher
And Lil Jon
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's
Up in the club with my homies
Tryna get a little V-I, keep it down on the low-key
'Cause you know how it is (Hey, hey)
I saw this shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear, you would think that she know me
I decided to chill (Okay)
Conversation got heavy (Hey)
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
Watch out!
Watch out!
She was sayin', "Come get me"
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, "Baby, let's go" (Hey)
Let's go
When I told her, I said

Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time comin', but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn , let it burn , gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn , let it burn , gotta let it burn

Watch this
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call

It's the only way we know how to rock
Do you remember, girl?
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
'Cause I remember, girl
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
Girl, I was there when you were my baby
It started when we were younger, you were mine
Now, another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes
Even though we used to argue, it's alright
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide
And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feelin' for nothing
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon' hear me say

Yeah
Ursher, baby

Got all of these niggas, they crowdin' around you like they seen Beyoncé in here
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax
I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

Yeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
Am I your
fire?
Your one
desire
Yes, I know it's
too late
But I want it that way

Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright!
Hey-yeah, oh
Oh my God, we're back again
Brothers, sisters, everybody sing
Gonna bring the flavor, show you how
Got a question for you, better answer now, yeah
Am I original?
Yeah
Am I the only one?
Yeah
Am I sexual?
Yeah
Am I everything you need?
You better rock your body now
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright!
Alright!

As long as you love me
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Riskin' it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
Where you're from, what you did
As long as you love me
Who you are, where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

Baby, oh-oh
Even in my heart, I see
You're not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart
Before you tear us apart
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop
You're tearing us apart
Quit playing games with my heart
I live my life the way
To keep you coming back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see

I got mixed emotions
Did I finally find me a river
That could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love
That leaves you battered and broken
So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got
Am I being too open?
'Cause I told you everything I have to say
And now we're having a moment
Does it make you wanna pack up all your things
And drive away like you stole it?
Just forgive me if I'm being too open
No no no no, yeah yeah yeah

Hmm, mmmh, yeah, yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every
minute it makes me weaker
You can
save me from the man
That I've become, oh yeah
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is trying to call you
help me
I can't wait there's more, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If I was
thinkin' it makes me weaker
You can
save me
from the man
I've become
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's somethin' missin' in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car to get to you
I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
But my love is all
I have to give
Without you I don't
think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
When you talk
Does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave
When you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
Getting close to you, but here we are

Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Woo
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent
In flashes of light
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Lookin' at the crowd
And I see your body sway, come on
Wishin' I could thank you
In a different way, come on

You fill me up 'til you're empty
I took too much and you let me
We've been down all these roads before
And what we found don't live there anymore
It's dark, it's cold
If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold
Maybe you'd be happier with someone else
Maybe loving me's the reason you can't love yourself
Before I turn your heart into a ghost town
Show me everything we built so I can tear it all down
Down, down, down, down
You know I'll stay, don't you tempt mе
But all this weight is getting heavy
Been holding up what wasn't mеant to stand
I turned this love into a wasteland
It's dark, it's cold
If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold

Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces
Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got
Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you
Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

There's nothing colder than your shoulder
When you're dragging me along like you do, like you do
And then you switch up with no warnin'
And you kiss me like you want it, how rude, how rude
But I kinda like it anyways
I don't mind if this is gonna take a million days
I know you'll come around to me eventually
If you sit back, relax, and join my company, my company
Once you know what my love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right, you can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream, taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies, 'cause it feels so
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know
My love is so mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know
My little hard-to-get baby
I wanna give you the world
Not saying you gotta chase me
But I wouldn't mind it
If you gave me just a little bit
Of something we can work it with
But all you do is push me out

I'd never met you, but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're
In your head right now
While your world is spinning out
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me slow it down

Oh, I remember how you were
You were every shade of perfect
And then the colors blurred
And you'll never love me like you did
You'll never love, you'll never love me like you did
And I see your ghost from time to time
When I'm driving through the Rockies
And I feel this little knife in my heart
And it bleeds me out
Don't wanna love, I don't wanna love you now
Oh, how come all the best things fall apart?
And it startеd pretty slowly
Oh, when you asked about thе old me
"Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone?" Oh, I don't know
I think I left him somewhere I no longer go
And I watch you run away now
From all the lovely things we hate now
Where did we go? Where did we go? Oh, I don't know
But I know it feels like somewhere far away from home
And it's falling into pieces
No, there's not a way that we can stop this now
One thousand miles an hour, we're driving off the edge
And, darling, now there's nothing left
And it started out so slowly

Momma, I'm missing home
And California's getting colder
And colder, and colder
I miss you
And, Momma, I'm getting old
Does that mean you're getting older
And older, and older?
I miss you
Momma, don't you know
There's nothing to be sorry about?
I'm so proud of all you've done
Take me down your old street
Tell me your memories of when you were young and when you fell in love
Drive me through the country
Tell me your story and you can play all of your favorite songs
'Cause I'm gonna need this
When I'm holding pictures of you and that's all that I've got left
All that I've got left
All that I've got left
Lately, it's getting hard
I've started looking like my father
And it makes me cry a little bit
'Cause he really should've made it big
'Cause, damn, he's good at everything
And everything I am's because of you
I'm a man because of you

I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
But it's good to see your face
And I really hope you're doin' well
I hope you're doin' well
She was runnin' late for dinner, South side of town
Left the phone a little bitter, but it's cool for now
Far from perfect for each other, but we're workin' it out, I suppose
Now I'm waiting at the diner, looking traumatized
'Cause you walk up to the table with an order of fries
And I know ya, yes, I know ya, used to love you
And I said
I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
It's good to see your face
And I really hope you're doin' well
I hope you're doin' well
I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
I wish that I could stay
And talk at the bar all by ourselves
But I'm here for someone else

I tried to hide it through the silence while I played along
I'm welling up behind my eyelids when I'm holding on
To the rage, so badly I hate him
And I wish that all of—
Nah, nah, nah, that doesn't feel right
Maybe, uh, speed it up
Yeah, that's nice
I really hate the way you think that you can get away
By blaming all your stupid problems on your mental state
I'm tired of burnt-out lies, oh
Ooh
You think you know me, but you hardly even know yourself
I'd bite my tongue and let you think I only wish you well
I don't, I know you know it
Ooh
And I'm tired of letting someone get the bеst of me, so go ahead and
Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin somеone else's life
Cry, cry
Go bug somebody else, so I can sleep at night

He was a stranger
He walked in looking for danger
When he stares at you
He can chain you down and make you fall in love
Heaven knows, yeah
They made him out of fire and roses
With an attitude
But he's sweet enough to put him on your tongue
He can be everything you've ever dreamed
Ooh, Mr. Electric Blue
I wanna dance like you
How did you get so cool?
And, oh, you got electric soul
You lеt the good times roll
Mr. Electric Bluе
They say that he fell from space
Or some supernatural place
Mr. Electric Blue
I know I believe in you

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because
My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess, I still believe
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Mmm, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, baby
Oops, I did it again,
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
, oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love, that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
You see, my problem is this
I'm dreamin' away
Wishin' that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

Baby, can't you see I'm callin'?
A guy like you should wear a warnin'
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's gettin' late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's takin' over me

It's Britney, bitch
I see you
And I just wanna dance with you
Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room
We can get down
Like there's no one around
We keep on rocking
We keep on rocking
Cameras are flashing
While we're dirty dancing
They keep watching
Keep watching,
feels like the crowd is saying
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I'm Miss American Dream, since I was seventeen
Don't matter if I step on the scene, or sneak away to the Philippines
You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Miss Bad Media Karma
Another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in workin' and bein' a mama
And with a kid on my arm,
I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "Oh my God, that Britney's shameless"
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "Extra! Extra! This just in"
You want a piece of me?
I'm Mrs. "She's too big, now she's too thin"
You want a piece of me?

Superstar, where you from? How's it goin'?
I know you, got a clue what you're doin'
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you, gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer
Womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
You got me goin'
You're oh-so-charmin'
But I can't do it
You womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
You say I'm crazy
I got your crazy
You're nothin' but a
Womanizer

One, two, three, not only you and me
Got one-eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Countin', one, two, three,
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Getting down with 3P
everybody loves—
Countin'
One, two, one-one-one-one, two, three
Countin', one, two, countin', one-one, two, three
Babe, pick a night to come out and play
If it's alright, what do you say?
Merrier the more, triple fun that way
Twister on the floor, what do you say?
Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing, yeah
Are you in?
I am countin'
One, two, three, not only you and me
Got one-eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Countin', one, two, three,
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves
Countin' one, two, three, not only you and me
Got one-eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Countin', one, two, three,
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves

Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said, "I want your body now"
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said, "I want your body now"
Would you hold it against me?
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out, 'cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it, you notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good-ish, sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waiting for?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out
Shame on me
To need release
Un-un-uncontrollably
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind, woah
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind, woah
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the bla-blanket
When the light's out

In this hard-hitting club smasher, Britney commands the wannabes to actually get to it, all while going Godzilla with her big bass.
You wanna?
You wanna?
You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
You want a Maserati? You better work, bitch
You want a Lamborghini? Sip martinis?
Look hot in a bikini?
You better work, bitch
You wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion?
Party in France?
You better work, bitch
You better work, bitch, you better work, bitch
You better work, bitch
Now get to work, bitch
Now get to work, bitch
Bring it on, ring the alarm
Don't stop now, just be the champion
Work it hard like it's your profession
Watch out now, 'cause here it comes

La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
Oh, baby, baby, have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom? Is she smoking up outside?
Oh, baby, baby, does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'ma buy her? Do you know just what she likes?
Oh, oh, tell me, have you seen her?
'Cause I'm so, oh, I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gon' go
Can somebody take me home?
Ha-ha, hee-hee, ha-ha, ho
Love me, hate me, say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la

Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time
I don't wanna be so shy, uh-oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

This is a story about a girl named Lucky
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say
"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

Tonight
I just wanna take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right
Players
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all tryna do?
24-karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Look out, uh
Pop-pop, it's show time , show time
Guess who's back again?
Oh, they don't know?  Oh, they don't know?
I bet they know as soon as we walk in
Wearin' Cuban links , designer minks
Inglewood's finest shoes
Don't look too hard, might hurt yourself
Known to give the color red the blues
Woo, shit
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
So many pretty girls around me and they wakin' up the rocket
Why you mad? Fix your face, ain't my fault they all be jockin'
Players only, come on

Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

Drop top Porsche , Rollie on my wrist
Diamonds up and down my chain
Cardi B, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook
My big fat ass got all them boys hooked
Went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands
Bruno sang to me while I do my money dance like
Ayy, flexin' on the 'Gram like
Ayy, hit the Lil Jon
Okay , okay
Oh, yeah, we drippin' in finesse and gettin' paid, ow
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight, I'm gonna show you off
When I walk in with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence or blame it on your measurements
Shut the shit down on sight
That's right

Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us, all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Ooh, I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
I'll unzip the back and watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door
'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing
Sayin', "There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of somethin' they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

One, two, one, two, three
Aw, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimmin' in your water's somethin' spiritual
I'm born again every time you spend the night, —ight
'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked outta heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked outta heaven
For too long
For too long

Oh-oh, oh, oh, ah
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have travelled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever
Exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay
Strollin' so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be

I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringin' me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singin' on my own
Now I can't find the key without you
And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
I'm sorry if it's all too much
Every day you're here, I'm healin'
And I was runnin' outta luck
I never thought I'd find this feelin'
'Cause I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless

Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration, foundation
A special bond of creation, ha
For all the single moms out there
Goin' through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean da Paul
Anne-Marie, sing, make them hear
She works the nights by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him
Daily struggle
She tells him, "Ooh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
Stay up there, stay up there
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gon' be nothin' like my life
Straight
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"
Stay up there, stay up there

I know you're out in Cabo
Hanging with your brother
Wishin' that I was your bottle
So I could be close to your lips again
I know you didn't call your parents
And tell 'em that we ended
'Cause you know that they'd be offended
Did you not want to tell 'em it's the end?
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So, I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Oh, I can't believe it, I
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I'm tryin' not to right now
You weren't a fan of pictures
So I hardly ever took 'em
Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom
So that way I can't forget your skin
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was

It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, e-e-e-everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you
It solo, solo, everybody
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool
It solo, solo, everybody
Since you've been gone
I've been dancin' on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause, baby, you're
The only one I'm comin' for
I can't take no more
No more, no more
I wanna f— , but I'm brokenhearted
Cry-cry-cry, but I like to party
Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f— , but I'm brokenhearted
Cry-cry-cry since the day we parted
Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

I tried hard to make you want me
But we're not supposed to be
And the truth will always haunt me
Even though it set me free
And my tears flow like the ocean
As they floated in the breeze
They were falling in slow motion
And they brought me to my knees
You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you
Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

Sé que te gusto a ti todavía
Tres, dos, uno
Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there, and my blood ran cold
Take me back to that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go
I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go
Find me in another place and time
If only, if only you were mine
But I'm already someone else's baby
Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's
C'mon
Baby, ah
Baby, ah
Baby, ah
I'm already someone else's

She works the nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come, she's got to save him
She tells him, "Oh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye
No, oh-oh
Rockabye

I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you
It solo, solo, everybody
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool
It solo, solo, everybody
Since you been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby, you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?
I see my body in a different light, ay ay ay
As if I woke up in a different life, ay ay ay
Feels like I'm walking with my heart on fire
Somebody pass me the water 'cause I'm burning
'Cause a little bit's turning into a lot
There's no way I'll be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought I was not
Tell me, tell me, ay ay ay
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?

J. Lo
to this
Headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real, I thought I told ya
I'm real even on
Oprah
That's just me
Nothing phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh

Love is life and life is living
It's very special
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Very special
Baby, don't go, uh
All my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
I understand, just chillin'
Baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
Why you actin' like that?
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreated me
And it's crazy, but oh, baby
Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hmm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together? I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
Wake up and rise and shine
Best get to work on time
No more playing video games
Things are about to change
We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hmm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together? I ain't your mama

If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?
Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, bae
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue, yeah
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

Oh, yeah
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Me plus you
Me plus you
One time; I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you
One time; I'ma tell you one time
One time
One time
When I met you, girl, my heart went knock, knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop, stop
And even though it's a struggle, love is all we got
So we gon' keep, keep climbing to the mountain top
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right
And girl, you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time
Girl, I love, girl, I love you
I'ma tell you one time
Girl, I love, girl, I love you
And I'ma be your one guy, you'll be my number one girl
Always makin' time for you
I'ma tell you one time
Girl, I love, girl, I love you
I'ma tell you one time
Girl, I love, girl, I love you

Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
You know you love me (Yo), I know you care (Uh-huh)
Just shout whenever (Yo), and I'll be there (Uh-huh)
You are my love (Yo), you are my heart (Uh-huh)
And we will never, ever, ever be apart (Yo, uh-huh)
Are we an item? (Yo) Girl, quit playin' (Uh-huh)
"We're just friends" (Yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)
Said, "There's another" (Yo), and looked right in my eyes (Uh-huh)
My first love broke my heart for the first time (Yo), and I was like (Uh-huh)
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I could take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby, take a chance, or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I don't know about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go
Tell me what you like, yeah, tell me what you don't
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I'ma make you shine bright, like you’re laying in the snow, burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind
Swaggy

As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now , you know, girl
We both know, it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, love me
As long as you love me, love me
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress , and don't cry
Oh, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take , my hand

Yeah
Young Money
Nicki Minaj
Justin, rrr
Show you off
Tonight, I wanna show you off
What you got
A billion could've never bought
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya
'Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all  'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
'Cause all—

What do you mean?  Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna  say no
What do you mean?  Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do  you mean? Oh,  what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time,  what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm sayin'
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complainin'
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night
First you're up, then you’re down, and then  between
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean? Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Hoppin' on the red-eye
Hoppin' on the red-eye
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent in your route
See you when I touch down
You're my champagne
You make me pop off everywhere like confetti
I know it seems strange
I seen you last night and I miss you already
My bed is depressed
My pillow's a victim
Got me in chills while my hands are sweaty (B-O-I)
And I gotta fly out (Ha)
Hate you got me strung-out (Ha)
And I gotta fly out (Hey)
Hate you got me strung-out, oh-ooh
Only been ten hours but my sanity is gone
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Ha)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag, oh, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Hey, big bag, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag, oh)

Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this
You encourage everyone without tryin'
All of your boundaries keep me in line
God is within us, what you're always sayin'
Your energy is enough to suffice
Your intentions are obvious
Your affection's miraculous
Every promise you make, you keep
Never met nobody else like this, only angels speak like this
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, la-di-da, la-di-da
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, di-da, la-da
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, di-da, da-da
Only angels speak like this

Had a dream, I was high
Holdin' on to the sky
But I heard your voice and stopped myself from fallin'
There'll be days, there'll be nights
When the stars don't align
And the sun can't even stop the rain from pourin'
So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go
'Cause all I know
This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what , no mattеr what
It's only us
Yeah, no matter what
Got you good, in the bag
Evеrything that I have
When the silence fills the air, just know I'm on it
When the waves start to crash
Like a fear from the past
Just remember that you're all I've ever wanted (Ever wanted)

Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
In the mornin' or the late
Say the word, on my way
Bona fide stallion
Ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run
Ain't on the side, you're number one
Yeah, every time I come around, you get it done
Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hundred racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS
Like a bitch, I would know
And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You don't really wanna stay, no
But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
’Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
I know it, I know it
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Ayy, yeah
Katy Perry, Migos, ayy
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby
Looks like you been starvin'
You got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cookin', boy
Let me take you
Under candlelight
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winnin'
lay 'em up like

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees (Yeah, yeah, undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek
What? What? What? (At us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent
now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ayy

Yeah, y'all know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy , your enemy
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no goin' back

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard with an open heart
How did I read the stars so wrong?
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see ain't always what it seems
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete
Fallin' from cloud nine
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
Well, those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
'Cause honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

Go for it
One, two
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek
They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, "Let's go out"
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Go back and tell it
Please, could you be tender?
And I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well, I guess I should go, yeah, I guess I should go
Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

Don't you think that it's
Boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again
Well, I'm bored
Because
I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasin' a million things I want
And I am
Only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showin' people how little we care
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah"
Pretty soon, I'll be getting
On my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city
Like they do in space
But my head's
Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm
Known?
And my
Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season, anyway
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feelin' low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old, o-old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
A-a-all we need is somebody to lean on

Bubble Butt is a single off Major Lazer’s Sophomore album “Free The Universe”. It features many artists like Tyga, Bruno Mars, Mystic Davis, and would later feature 2 Chainz.

They thought that you was a shy girl
Until I made you my girl
Girl you pushed me like a big button
'Til I cuffed you like you did somethin'
You ain't gotta wait for it
You ain't gotta wait for me to give you my love
You ain't gotta wait for it
Things are gettin' sticky, girl I think that I'm stuck
I'll admit I'm wrong when I know that you gon' come for me
When you gon' come for me, yeah
Never gonna not not hit that, your lovin' is drugs to me
When you gon' come to me, yeah
And every time you hit my phone, when you say you need company, oh

I'ma run up on you
I'ma run up on you


Yeah (Straight up)
Ooh
Wrist lookin' like it been dipped
Dipped in that, dipped in that, dipped in that
Script lookin' like it been flipped
Flippin' that, flippin' that, flippin' that (Yeah)
Pull up in that foreign, my God (Skrrt, skrrt)
Whole squad get in that, get in that
Please say it ain't true, I had to go and cop two
Hell nah, we can't fit in that
Wild ones, like we fresh out the cage
Showtime, baby, fresh off the stage
Bad lil' mama, fresh off the page
Front like you love
But you know that you hate it (Yeah, you hate it)
Yeah, you know no better
Yeah, you know no better (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, you know no better, ooh
Yeah, you know no better
Say you different, who you kidding?
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh, save that talk for the ones
Who don't know no better (Know no better)
'Cause, baby, I know you better ('Cause, baby, I know no better)
Baby, I know you better (Baby, I know)
Baby, I know you better

Yeah
Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee give in
What can I do to get the money?
We ain't got the money, we ain't getting out
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearing thin
All I need's relief
I need, I need some sympathy, yeah
Look at me
I just can't believe what they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
Look at me
I just can't believe what they've done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream
All of my life been wading in
Water so deep, now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long, how long 'til we have a friend?
Coming down, feeling like a battery hen
Waves won't break 'til the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise?
What will I do without my dreams?

Onazo, yeah
Onazo
They told me everybody's 15 minutes in a different timezone
And since I have it at the moment, you the one I wanna shine my light on
Get your life, get your life, little mama, won't you get your life on?
Ain't nothing cooler than the wrong moves, when you do 'em to the right song, the right song
Let's shoot this movie and put the shit on repeat
I hope this Mary's not making you fall asleep
Before we hit the road, put our phones on silent
Nobody's tryna bring sand to the beach
What would it take to change your plans for the weekend?
'Cause I am tryna kick it like EA
The whole thing, the pre-party, the pre-sex
Now we hit the Major League where the G's at
I like you, girl, in particula
You in particula
Sey I like your waist in particula, ah ha, eh
I like you, girl, in particula, yeah
You in particula
Sey I like your waist in particula, ah ha, eh

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me

We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A

The truth is bulletproof, there's no foolin' you
I don't dress the same
Me and who you say I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
'Cause that's for chasin' cars
Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts
And goin' way too far
I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'causе I
used to be young
Take onе, pour it out, it's not worth cryin' 'bout
The things you can't erase
Like tattoos and regrets,
words I never meant
And ones that got away
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
And took another road
Turns out crowded rooms empty out as soon
There's somewhere else to go, oh-oh

It's our party, we can do what we want (Ear Drummers, ooh)
It's our party, we can say what we want (Mike WILL Made-It, ooh)
It's our party, we can love who we want (Ooh)
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want (Ayy)
It's our party, we can do what we want (Ooh)
It's our party, we can say what we want (Ooh)
It's our party, we can love who we want (Ooh)
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want (Right about now, ayy)
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "hell no"?
'Cause we gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party
Dancin' with Molly
Doin' whatever we want
This is our house, this is our rules

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away



Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah, Rihanna)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Good Girl Gone Bad)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Comin' down with the Dow Jones (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
When the clouds come, we go, we Roc-A-Fella (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me (You know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at? (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said "I'll always be your friend"
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella
Ella-ella, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standin' side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go-ooh-oh

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
[Verse 2: Kanye West &
Paul McCartney
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz
Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want

Yayo, yayo
Mula-la
Yayo
Bitch better have my money
Y'all should know me well enough
Bitch better have my money
Please don't call me on my bluff
Pay me what you owe me
Ballin' bigger than LeBron

Who y'all think y'all frontin' on?

Louis XIII, and it's all on me, nigga, you just bought a shot
Kamikaze, if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot

Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Pay me what you owe me

Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe

We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, whoa
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
American oxygen, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
Oh, say can you see
This is the American Dream
Young girl, hustlin'
On the other side of the ocean
You can be anything at all
In America, America
I say if you can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

I believed all of your dreams, adoration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been, mm
But I wake up and act like nothing's wrong
Just get ready fi work, work, work, work, work, work
He said me haffi work, work, work, work, work, work

Before the tables turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn

And you got me like, oh
What you want from me? (What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby, you got me like, oh, mmm
You love when I fall apart (Fall apart)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall
Baby, you got me like, I, woo, I
Don't you stop loving me (Loving me)
Don't quit loving me (Loving me)
Just start loving me, oh (Loving me)
And, babe, I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something, babe?
And I'll run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way (Feeling this way)
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (Cursing my name)
No matter what I do, I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain

Mustard on the beat, ho!
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
So, when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take "no"
I love it when you do what you want 'cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we out late
We don't care what them people say
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So, baby, be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot, it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So, baby, be the life of the party
Together, we can just let go
Pretending like there's no one else here that we know
Slow dance, fall in love as the club track plays
We don't care what them people say

I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left
seein' red
on my own

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off, but I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time in this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mmm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mmm
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying, baby
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy?
Mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy?
Mercy on my heart
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride is all I got
I'm saying, baby

I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessin', yeah
Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better
Does it ever?
Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
Oh, I gotta ask
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name
, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah
I love it when you call
señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you know I love it when you call
señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah
But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool
, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up , liftin' me up
And tearin' me down , tearin' me down
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one

I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I'll forget about them
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by
I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder, I wonder

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anythin', when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down
I'm the one for a good time call
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, I feel the love
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly
Like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
But I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight, on for tonight

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long

Uh-oh, runnin' out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, I need another lover, be mine
'Cause I, I, I got stamina
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no, no, no
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no, no, no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Well, uh-oh, runnin' out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, runnin' now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
And oh yeah, runnin' through the waves of love
But I, I got stamina
And oh yeah, I'm runnin' and I've just enough
And uh-oh, I got stamina

Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me
Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling?
If you can't catch me, darling
Don't cry, snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
Can't hold me close, baby
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on, let's go
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, baby
My snowman and me,
My snowman and me
Baby
Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey?
Without legs to run, honey
Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby?
If you don't have ears, baby

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh

I took a page out of your favorite book
You sold me lies just by the way you look
Taught me a language that I'd never speak
Baby, that ain't for me, that, that ain't for me
I dug my grave watchin' the way you move
You took me higher than I ever flew, ooh
Too many times, gave you a second chance
Baby, I'm just a man, I'm, I'm just a man
No more thinkin' about you late night
No more runnin' around with your friends and I'm
Done pickin' the pieces of my
Soul up off the floor, oh, oh
I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willin'
But tonight, I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't wanna lose you, baby
But I can't play this gamе no more
I thought it would kill me
But tonight, I saved my lifе when I showed you the door

Sun is going down, time is running out
No one else around but me
Steady losing light, steady losing my mind
Moving shadows and grinding teeth
Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I'd do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you, I keep
Slipping into bad dreams
Where there's no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these
Bad dreams
Waitin' on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these, all of these
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bad dreams
Ooh, ooh, ooh
All of these

Are you even real
Or did I make you up?
How could someone like you
Wanna give me love?
Don't think I deserve you
But I can't get enough
You're so beautiful, spiritual
More like a miracle
Part of me's scared that you
Might be invisible
Too good to be true
Tell me
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Made up in my head, or are you in my bedroom?
Questions that I ask ever since I met you
Tеll me
Are you , arе you
Are you, are you
Somethin' from a dream or somethin' that I made up?
Questions that I ask every time that I wake up

No, woah
I woke up this morning kinda mad
Flipped a switch, I had the urge to beat your ass
Mm-mm
Turnin' up you in a different state
You fucked it up with me all kinds of ways, I'm mad
Boy, I'm so mad
You wanna tell me it was nothing
Why don't you tell me I'm a fool?
Say you're sorry 'bout it
I would be, too
I got no mercy
You don't deserve me, no
And you might be hurtin'
But damn it, you hurt me, boy
So I'll watch you suffer
Crawl back to me on broken glass
And you better love her
Regret will drive a person mad
I got no mercy
That shit was dirty
Dirty, dirty, dirty

Walking down the street last night
Watching strangers pass me by
Where do all our shadows go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know
I can fool my senses for a little while
But some things are too hard to reconcile
When I look into your eyes
There's no answers I can't find
It's a feeling that I've never known
And, when I'm wide awake tonight
Running circles in my mind
There's an answer I can't find
When did your heart let me go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know
I guess, somе things, I'll never know
I'm running out of avenuеs
'Cause every road leads back to you
When memories fade, where do they go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know


Of havin' only eyes for you
Of letting you turn my crimson skies blue, ooh
Of hatin' your somebody new
Of gettin' hella jealous of the ground that's under you, ooh
Of goin' way too hard
Or tryna call you while I'm stormin' out the bar
Of goin' way across the line
Of needin' you at the end of every night
I'm guilty, baby
I'm guilty, baby
If havin' a bleeding heart is a crime
If lovin' you means I'm servin' life
I'm guilty, baby
Of usin' medicine as a crutch
On the nights when the voices in my head won't shut up (Oh)
Of goin' way (Of goin' way) too far (Too far)
Or drivin' by your place and countin' up the cars (Up the cars)
Of goin' way (Of goin' way) across the line (Across the line)
Of needin' you at the end of every night

God went crazy when He painted you
Ain't seen nothin' like this before, mm
Took a little extra time on you
Before He let you walk out the door
You got that smile, babe
You got that subtle Mona Lisa, drive me wild, babe
I'd give it all up just to keep you by my side, babe
I knew it from the jump
Fit right in my arms like you the one
Yeah, I'm made for you
I prayed for you
There's a light in your eyes every color in the sky
Don't come close to
Yеah, I'm made for you
I prayed for you
Swear that God wеnt crazy when He painted you
Ooh
Ooh
