We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
“You Belong with Me” tells the story of a boy who is too wrapped up in a toxic relationship to see how much another girl likes him. It appears on Taylor’s sophomore album, Fearless.
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
“Shake It Off” is an upbeat track that encourages listeners to let go of small problems. It spent four weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 song chart, staying on the chart for a consecutive fifty weeks, as…
I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least, that's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Taylor Swift plays her “serial dater” image to her advantage with “Blank Space,” a synth-pop anthem that the RIAA certified 8x platinum in July 2018. Swift explained to GQ in October 2015 that she wrote the…
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
As Swift said in her Rolling Stone interview:
For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, ‘Are we…
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
The lead single from the highly anticipated follow-up to 1989 takes shots at several unnamed rivals, who most fans suspect to be Kanye West, Kim Kardashian West, and Katy Perry — see this video for more. The…
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Described by Taylor herself as “one of my favorite songs that I have ever written”, “Anti-Hero” is the scintillating lead single from Midnights, her tenth studio album. Largely serving as a parallel to 2019’s…
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Accompanied by the release of her project written and recorded during the lockdown due to COVID-19, “cardigan” is the lead single from Taylor Swift’s eighth studio album, folklore.
Its music video — which…
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
“willow” is the lead single of evermore, Swift’s second surprise album of 2020 and her ninth record overall. She released the accompanying music video at midnight EST on December 11th, 2020, alongside the…
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Widely regarded as one of Swift’s best songs, “All Too Well” sees her picking up shards of memories after a gut-wrenching breakup. She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex,…
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
Taylor Swift refuses to continue an on-and-off relationship with her boyfriend and declares that “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”.
The song was released as the lead single for Taylor Swift’s fourth…
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
The sixth track on Red finds Taylor Swift celebrating her early twenties by having some  fun.
The song was written when Taylor Swift celebrated her 22nd birthday. The hidden message in the album…
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two
The title track of Swift’s album compares the emotions she felt in a relationship to colors. It was originally released as a promotional single, but was re-released as the album’s fifth official single a year…
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
“Fearless” is about the feelings present when a new relationship begins. It is the title track of Taylor’s sophomore album and has become a fan-favorite over the years.
Taylor explained a bit about what the…
There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one-horse town,
I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it
“Speak Now” transports listeners to Taylor’s daydream where she crashes her ex’s wedding so he won’t be stuck with a girl who doesn’t treat him right. It’s rumored to be inspired by Hayley Williams of…
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
“Mine” is the lead single from Taylor’s third studio album Speak Now.
It tells the story of a girl whose parents' failed marriage has caused her to take a pessimistic view on love. Over time she falls in…
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
“Back to December” sees Taylor apologizing to her ex Taylor Lautner, actor and Valentine’s Day co-star, for ending their relationship. In a Facebook Live interview promoting his show Scream Queens, Taylor…
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
Swift wrote “Mean” in response to music critic Bob Lefsetz, who gave her a cruel review after a February 2010 performance with Stevie Nicks. Lefsetz claimed that Swift “can’t sing” and that the performance…
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
Swift wrote “The Story of Us” after an awkward encounter with ex John Mayer at the 2010 CMT Music Awards, where both parties tried to ignore each other’s presence. She told USA Today that she came up with the…
I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter
“Tim McGraw,” which Taylor wrote in her freshman math class, was her debut single and first-ever published song. At the time, she was dating a senior named Drew Dunlap and believed they would break up before…
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
“Picture to Burn” is an angsty breakup song about Jordan Alford, who went on to date, and later marry, one of Taylor’s former friends named Chelsea. Chelsea told Daily Mail:
just thought it…
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
There's nothin' stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
And if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health
“Teardrops On My Guitar” illustrates the unrequited love Taylor felt for classmate Drew Hardwick. Taylor told fans that Drew would often ask her for advice and date ideas for his girlfriend, and she would…
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
“A Place In This World” is a song written about the uncertainty of what the future holds, along with the acceptance that whether it all works out or doesn’t, life will go on.
The song was written when Taylor…
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
But that's okay
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
“Cold as You” is the fifth track of Swift’s debut album and details her experience with an emotionally unavailable guy. Unlike Shakespeare who compares his lover to a summer’s day Swift compares her lover to…
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
“The Outside” was written by Swift about loneliness. She wrote it when just she was 12 years old.
It’s about what I was going through…
I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now, it's all too late, so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything
“Tied Together with a Smile” is a song about a friend of Taylor’s with an eating disorder. She talked about it in an interview with Entertainment Weekly:
I wrote  about one of…
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true
'Cause I know you
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Oh, oh
“Stay Beautiful” is a cute, heartfelt song about a boy Taylor had a crush on in high school. It epitomizes high school relationships, acknowledging that things may not work out between the two, but still…
Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, "Hey, by the way"
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
“Mary’s Song ” was inspired by Taylor’s next-door neighbors, an old couple that had known each other since they were just kids. They were talking with Taylor one night about how they met, and she…
She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said,
"Oh, my, my, my"
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"
“Teardrops On My Guitar” illustrates the unrequited love Taylor felt for classmate Drew Hardwick. Taylor told fans that Drew would often ask her for advice and date ideas for his girlfriend, and she would…
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe

Swift solely composed “Our Song” for the talent show of her freshman year in high school.. It’s about Taylor’s first boyfriend, Drew Dunlop. It was included on Taylor Swift due to its popularity with her…
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said
“I’m Only Me When I’m With You” is the twelfth song from the bonus track version of Taylor’s debut eponymous album, Taylor Swift.
The song is about Taylor and her best friend Abigail Anderson. It speaks…
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do
The thirteenth track on Taylor Swift’s eponymous debut album  finds her lamenting on someone who doesn’t even notice her.
People have theorized that the song is about Drew Hardwick, the person who inspired…
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Oh, yeah, oh
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
“Perfectly Good Heart” is one of Taylor Swift’s first breakup songs. In it, she describes her very first experience with heartbreak, yet also hints there are more to come in her future.
It appears as the…
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
In “Fifteen,” Taylor looks back at her freshman year at Hendersonville High. Taylor wrote the song about her best friend, Abigail Anderson, who she met during ninth grade and is still best friends with.
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say "hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
“Hey Stephen” was written for Stephen Barker Liles from the country music duo Love And Theft, who were an opening act on her Fearless Tour in 2008. The song’s hidden message in the album booklet for Fearless…
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same
Swift told Billboard magazine: “It’s one of the songs that I am really proud of on the record because it’s so sparse – it’s guitar, piano and cello. It talks about falling in love and the fairy tales that you…
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

“Breathe” is a country-pop song performed by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, featuring Colbie Caillat as the co-writer and backing vocals. The song was written by Swift and Caillat and produced by…
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift
with Colbie Caillat
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift
with Colbie Caillat
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break,
no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
[Chorus: Taylor Swift
with Colbie Caillat
And I can't
breathe
without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
[Verse 3: Taylor Swift
with Colbie Caillat
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
Taylor Swift co-wrote this with her frequent collaborator Liz Rose. She explained that the song was inspired by her frustration at a boy that she liked who kept acting up.
I walked into Liz’s house, and I…
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
“You’re Not Sorry” is a country song performed by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was solely written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift’s aid. It was released on October 28…
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
You're not sorry
In “The Way I Loved You,” Taylor finds herself missing the passionate, albeit unstable, relationship she had with her ex. She acknowledges how perfect her current relationship is, but her feelings for him…
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and
endearing
And I'm comfortable
“Forever & Always” is the eleventh track off Taylor Swift’s second studio album, Fearless.
The song was inspired by her recent break up with Joe Jonas. She described it as a song about a relationship with a…
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now, you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it
rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
Swift wrote “The Best Day” about her mother, Andrea Swift, and the good effects her mother had on her growing up.
In an interview with Taste of Country, Swift talked about how special her mom is to her:
She…
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today
