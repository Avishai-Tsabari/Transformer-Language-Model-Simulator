Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home,
you're like a dream come true
But, if by chance, you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie, you sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together at Skyfall
At Skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Just the guitar, okay, cool
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me, mmm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me, mmm
That was what you told me
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I built a house for a love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears
But, oh my
Oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Tryna learn to lean into it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right

When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holdin' me the way you do
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?
It's so cold out here
In your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never-endin', we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please, stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all, the more that we will fight

How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied
You better believe I'm tryin'
To keep climbin'
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm findin' it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely
Angelo Adkins
Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent
I don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save mе
Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel likе that?
Do you like me?
You know mummy doesn't like anyone else like I like you, right?
I'm holdin' on
Mama's got a lot to learn
I'm holdin' on
Mama's got a lot to learn

Hold on
You are still strong
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on
Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off
It's hard to hold on to who I am
When I'm stumblin' in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling with myself, with no chance to win
Let time be patient
Let pain be gracious
Just hold, hold on
I swear to God, I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress
I'm my own worst enemy
Right now, I truly hate bein' me
Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?

I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me comin' back even though I'm terrified
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Under haunted skies, I see you, ooh
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

Pink, it's my new obsession, yeah
Pink, it's not even a question
Pink on the lips of your lover
'Cause pink is the love you discover
Pink, as the bing on your cherry
Pink, 'cause you are so very
Pink, it's the color of passion
'Cause today it just goes with the fashion
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light
And pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight
You could be my flamingo
'Cause pink is the new kinda lingo
Pink, like a deco umbrella
Yeah, it's kink, but you don't ever tell her, yeah
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light
Yeah, pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight

I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and
I hit the floor
Yeah, I
thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
That one last shot's a
permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

Hey, j-j-jaded
You got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be?
You're getting it all over me, ex-rated
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I been thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you
Hey, j-j-jaded
In all its misery
It will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side
We're thinking of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm so jaded
And baby, I'm afraid of you

I'm dreaming tonight, I'm living back home
Right
Yeah, yeah
Take me back to a south Tallahassee
Down 'cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Can't stand up on my feet in the city
Got to get back to the real nitty-gritty
Yes, sir, no, sir
Don't come close to my
Home sweet home
Can't catch no dose
Of my hot tail poontang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J. Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer
Home sweet home
Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma, she's a-cooking
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto

There's something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't His
It sure ain't no surprise, yeah
We're livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
There's something wrong with the world today
The light bulb's getting dim
There's meltdown in the sky
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister, you're a better man than I
We're livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge

Aerosmith scored their first top 20 single in ten years with “Dude ”, the first single from Permanent Vacation. But its third single, “Angel”, outdid all of their previous hits.
I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
And the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
Don't know what I'm gonna do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride, yeah, yeah
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone

I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
Riding into town alone
By the light of the moon
I'm looking for old Sukie Jones
She crazy horse saloon
Barkeep give me a drink
That's when she caught my eye
She turned to give me a wink
That'd make a grown man cry
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
Come easy, go easy
All right until the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight
I'm like a loaded gun
Peeling off my boots and chaps
I'm saddle sore
Four bits gets you time in the racks
I scream for more
Fool's gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back

Ooooh, yeah
There goes my old girlfriend
There's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises?
I guess they don't mean a thing
So, baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back
I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

It ain't easy livin' like a gypsy
Tell you, honey, how I feel
I been dreamin', floatin' down stream, and
Losin' touch with all that's real
Whole earth lover, keepin' undercover
Never knowin' where you've been
You've been fadin', always out paradin'
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Well, you've always got your tail on the wag
Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon
It ain't easy living like you wanna
And it's so hard to find peace of mind, yes, it is
The way I see it, you got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

“Big Ten-Inch Record” is a cover of ‘dirty blues’ sax man Bull Moose Jackson’s 1952 song. It was written as a double entendre about ten-inch vinyl records that were common in the early 1900s.
Got me the strangest woman
Believe me this trick's no cinch
But I really get her going
When I whip out my big ten inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues
Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
She said now stop that jivin'
Now whip out your big ten inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues
I, I, I cover her with kisses
And when we're in a lover's clinch
She gets all excited
When she begs for my big ten inch

Every time​ that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face gettin' clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win
Half my life's in books' written pages
Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'
While you're far away and dreamin'
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Lyin' close to you, feelin' your heart beatin'
And I'm wonderin' what you're dreamin'
Wonderin' if it's me you're seein'
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever
Forever and ever

Always hidin' 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to your daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothin'
'Til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways"
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I know love was here to stay
When she told me to

There was a time
When I was so broken-hearted
Luck wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
So listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me, yeah!
Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

Oh, good morning Mr. Tyler, going down?
Hehehehehe, ooh
Yeah!
Workin' like a dog for the boss man
Workin' for the company
Bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'
I'm gonna have a fantasy
But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
To read between the lines
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Shaggin' in the elevator
Lingerie second floor
She said, "Can I see you later"
"And love you just a little more?"
I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out alive
She said, "I'll show you how to fax in the mail room, honey
And have you home by five"

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing out things that nobody wears
You're calling my name, but I got to make clear
I can't say, baby, where I'll be in a year
Some sweathog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go musta got up and went
Well, I got good news, she's a real good liar
‘Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
That, that
That, that
Backstage, we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
"Forgive me if I seem out of line"
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways, you hear me?
Say you're leavin' on a 7:30 train
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood
Girl, you've been givin' me that line so many times
It kinda gets like feelin' bad looks good, yeah
That kinda loving turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving sends a man right to his grave
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue

Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound of my gun
Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?
They said when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But, man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her
dog day
's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and
the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain

Rag doll,
living in a movie
Hot tramp,
daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see you
Leaving by the back door, man
Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby, won't you do me
Like you done before?
I'm feeling like a bad boy
Mmm, just a like a bad boy
I'm ripping up a rag doll
Like throwing away an old toy
Some babe's talking real loud
Try and sell me on an old dream
A new version of the old scene
Speakeasy on the grapevine
Keep shuffling in a shoe shine
Old Tin Lizzy
, do it 'til you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery
Rag doll, living in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see you
Leaving by the back door, man
Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby, won't you do me
Like you done before?

You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
You crossed the line and it's time to say "F you"
What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
Noah Cyrus
Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try
staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope
, but I still
can't let you go

We're not in love
We share no stories
Just somethin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side
Fall into the dark side
Give in to the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side

I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment before I go, it's nothing personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand
So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
Blep, yah, yah
Farru
Yah-yah-yah-yah

Hello, sweet grief
I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the mornin' after ecstasy
I am drownin' in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doin' everything I can
To make sure I never love again
I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

We were young, posters on the wall
Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
We would stare at each other
'Cause we were always in trouble
And all the cool kids did their own thing
I was on the outside always looking in
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
They never really cared if I wasn't
We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
Then I saw your face, your forgiving eyes
Looking back at me from the other side
Like you understood me
And I'm never letting you go, oh

Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away

Woah
Eyes up, you've been gone for a fortnight
My love, are you stuck in a fake life?
Can't win, if the prize is to waste your time
Now it's wasting mine
And I know that we're close, but I'm lonely
Make me your only, won't win a trophy
But can it kiss you like this when you hold me?
Missing it lowkey, I'll say it slowly
It's me or the PS5
Tell me how you wanna spend your night
Three's feeling way too tight
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
Me or the PS5
Tell me which of us is more your type
Seems like you can't decide
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
Oh-oh

I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Cold hands, red eyes
Packed two bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Wait a second, let me catch my breath
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice
Anywhere, anytime
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep
Remember me now, time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby

Hello, hello, can you hear me as I scream your name?
Hello, hello, do you need me before I fade away?
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie
Hello, hello, nice to meet you, voice inside my head
Hello, hello, I believe you, how can I forget?
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark, I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie
We live, we love, we lie

In the dark of night
The stars light up the sky
We see them flying free
That's just like you and me
Everyone is lonely sometimes
But I would walk a thousand miles to see your eyes
You are not alone, we are family
Hold me, let's escape all this reality
You are my symphony
By your side, we are unity
You are my energy
My guiding light, we are unity
We are unity
We are unity
Although the rain might pour
A thunder starts to roar
The lightnin' wakes the wave
But through it, we are brave

Mm, yeah
Mirrors, they never lie
Don't see myself inside
Why can't I get it right?
I don't know
You're always watching me fall
Shadows, they like my wall
Why do I feel so small?
I don't know
So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know
I lost, I lost, I lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame, I lost control again
I don't, I don't, I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame, I lost control again
Ooh

“Different World” is a promo and final single by EDM producer Alan Walker from his debut album Different World.
All we know
Left untold
Beaten by a broken dream
Nothing like what it used to be
We've been chasing our demons down an empty road
Been watching our castle turning into dust
Escaping our shadows just to end up here
Once more
And we both know
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
Broken smile, tired eyes
I can feel your longing heart
Call my name, howling from afar

Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then, she tried to run
And then on a night with the settin' sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone
They've warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hidin' in the dark
Then somethin' came creepin'
It told her, "Don't you worry, just
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh"
Just let me in, ooh

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
Y-y-y-you think you're so small like you're itty-bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walkin' by strangers on the side of the street
Like a quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of m-m-m-mind, like
Like it's just a waste of time, like-like-like
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world

Hey
I know what I came to do
And that ain't gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
'Cause I won't take the bait
I'm over here doin' what I like
I'm over here workin' day and night
And if my real ain't real enough
I'm sorry for you, babe
Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holdin' us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me (
Focus
), f-f-focus on me, woo (
Focus on me
Focus on me (
Focus
), f-f-focus on me, woo (
Focus on me
I can tell you're curious
It's written on your lips
Ain't no need to hold it back
Go 'head and talk your shit
I know you're hopin' that I'll react
I know you're hopin' I'm lookin' back
But if my real ain't real enough
Then I don't know what is

Oh, yeah
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'—

You got me some type of way
Ain't used to feelin' this way
I do not know what to say
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face
Now I wanna know how you taste
Usually don't give it away
But you know I'm already thinkin' 'bout it
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"
Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin'
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right, but I don't care
Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
This shit always happen to me
Why can't we just play for keeps?
Practically on my knees
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you already thinkin' 'bout it

Mmm
Hey, yeah
I'm stuck with you
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby

I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothin' at all
It's comin' down on me
Water like misery
It's comin' down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain on me
Mm, oh yeah, baby
Rain on me
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try, mm
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah

Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hopin’ I don't repeat history
Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday
Never need no , no one else, babe
’Cause I'll be
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do
That I won't do, switchin’ for you
Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true
But I get tired of runnin', fuck it
Now, I’m runnin' with you
Said, boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday
Never need no , no onе else, babe
'Causе I'll be

In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on
Come on and walk this way through the fire
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like
"Yes, and?"
Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "What's next?"
"Yes, and?"
Now, I'm so done with caring
What you think, no, I won't hide
Underneath your own projections
Or change my most authentic life

You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman
I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it
And I can be all the things you told me not to be
When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
And he see the universe when I'm the company
It's all in me

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side
I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I—
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side

Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin' , I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up , pickin' it up
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but, boy, I like it
I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We out here vibin'
We vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now
Can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah

Hmm
You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been cravin'
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies
So what you doin' tonight?
Better say, "Doin' you right"
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight
I don't wanna keep you up
But show me, can you keep it up?
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy
I've been drinkin' coffee
And I've been eatin' healthy
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah
Savin' up my energy
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm
Sometimes, it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better 'cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you
So, one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should've been more careful

Step up, the two of us, nobody knows us
Get in the car like, "Skrrt"
Staying up all night, order me pad thai
Then we gon' sleep 'til noon
Me with no makeup, you in the bathtub
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never
Act this regular
Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world
Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, "Ooh"
Feels like forever, baby, I never
Thought that it would be you
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit
That's how I know it's true
Baby, direct it, name in the credits
Like the movies do

It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothin' from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
I wanna love me
The way that you love me
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me
The way that you trust me
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared
Learnin' to be grateful for myself
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine

I'm a motherfuckin' train wreck
I don't wanna be too much
But I don't wanna miss your touch
And you don't seem to give a fuck
I don't wanna keep you waiting
But I do just what I have to do
And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't allowed to have no boo
'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten, it's crazy
I can't have what I want, but neither can you
You ain't my boyfriend
And I ain't your girlfriend
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend
And I ain't your girlfriend
But you don't want me to touch nobody else
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody
Even though you ain't mine, I promise the way we fight
Make me honestly feel like we just in love
'Cause, baby, when push comes to shove
Damn, baby, I'm a train wreck, too
I lose my mind when it comes to you
I take time with the ones I choose
And I don't want a smile if it ain't from you, yeah

If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish
But after all this damage, I can’t help it
But what you can trust is I need your touch

I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him
We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah

You know, you have to be free in this world
You have to glow, you gotta drip, you gotta, like, express yourself, you know?
But you can't do that when you give everybody your power
They'll do whatever they want with you
You know, you can't do that
Ernähr' mich von Glyphosat und UVA
Lass' mich berieseln von dem Größenwahn
Was nicht schön ist, wird schön gesagt
Pflanze auf Beton, ich komm' im Garten an
Ich versicher' meine Artefakte
Bin gespannt, welches der viralen TikToks später im Museum landet
Bleibt die Seele odеr nur die Maske?
Ist es Kunst und ist еs das dann nur, wenn es als Kunst verpackt ist?
Stell mir 'ne Selbstdiagnose: ADHS
Gib mir alles, aber nimm mir nicht das Handy weg
Wie viele Talkshows muss ich schau'n, bis ich die Welt verstanden hab'?
Das lyrische Ich frisst sich am liebsten an Dystopien satt
Gib mir das Mic gib mir den Raum, gib mir die Aufmerksamkeit
Gib mir das High, gib mir das Low, ich hab' nicht mehr viel Zeit
Gib mir den Schlüssel aus der Matrix, ich will alles draußen seh'n
Alles, damit ich die Zeit nach mir überleb'

If you're lookin' for perfect, well, I ain't
Sometimes a sinner more than saint
Seems like I spend most my time
In the gray between the black and white
Fly with angels, run with demons
Some days I'm just breakin' even
Just 'cause I'm not the Sunday mornin' crowd
Don't mean that I'm more lost than found
And, oh-oh-oh
It might sound a little crazy
But, oh-oh-oh
God talks to me
I heard Him in momma's prayers back when I didn't care
He was tellin' me He was right there
And He spoke through the sound of the crash with that metal and glass
Sayin', "Son, you're goin' way too fast"
You might not believe
But God talks to me
Yeah, God talks to me

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

Yeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
Am I your
fire?
Your one
desire
Yes, I know it's
too late
But I want it that way

Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright!
Hey-yeah, oh
Oh my God, we're back again
Brothers, sisters, everybody sing
Gonna bring the flavor, show you how
Got a question for you, better answer now, yeah
Brian
Am I original?
Yeah
Am I the only one?
Yeah
Am I sexual?
Yeah
Am I everything you need?
You better rock your body now
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright!
Alright!

As long as you love me
with Brian
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Riskin' it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
Where you're from, what you did
As long as you love me
Who you are, where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
with Kevin
Nick
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

Baby, oh-oh
Even in my heart, I see
You're not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart
Before you tear us apart
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop
You're tearing us apart
Quit playing games with my heart
I live my life the way
To keep you coming back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see

I got mixed emotions
Did I finally find me a river
That could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love
That leaves you battered and broken
So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got
Am I being too open?
'Cause I told you everything I have to say
And now we're having a moment
Does it make you wanna pack up all your things
And drive away like you stole it?
Just forgive me if I'm being too open
No no no no, yeah yeah yeah

Hmm, mmmh, yeah, yeah
with Howie
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every
minute it makes me weaker
You can
save me from the man
That I've become, oh yeah
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
with Kevin
Howie
Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is trying to call you
help me
I can't wait there's more, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If I was
thinkin' it makes me weaker
You can
save me
from the man
I've become
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's somethin' missin' in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Brian
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car to get to you
I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
But my love is all
I have to give
Without you I don't
think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
When you talk
Does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave
When you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

“Chances” is a love song describing a serendipitous encounter between a boy and a girl that blossoms into a loving relationship. The boy is expressing his gratitude at being so lucky.
What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
Getting close to you, but here we are

Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Woo
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent
In flashes of light
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Brian
Lookin' at the crowd
And I see your body sway, come on
Wishin' I could thank you
In a different way, come on

“Incomplete” is the power ballad that put the Backstreet Boys back on the map in the mid-2000’s.
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you, within me, I can't find no rest
Where I'm going, is anybody's guess
with Howie
I tried
to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake,
but my world is half asleep
I pray
for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is
Incomplete
with Howie
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming
in an ocean all alone
Baby,
my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake
I tried
to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake
, but my world is half asleep
I pray
for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is
Incomplete

Oh-oh yeah
Don't pretend you're sorry
I know you're not
You know you got the power
To make me weak inside
And girl you leave me breathless
But it's okay
'Cause you are my survival
Now hear me say
I can't imagine
Life without your love
And even forever
Don't seem like long enough
Brian
'Cause every time I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep drowning in your love

"Hello"
"Hi, it's me. Wassup baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So, don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"W-Wait? Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out. I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me, we're going to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!"
with All
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
When there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No,
someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Howie
I've been to Paris, made my way down to Rome
Seen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico
But I could care less, 'cause I was all alone
And there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
You're my daybreak, you're my California sun
You're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one
In the city, the country, the mountains or sea
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you, no

Yeah
I'm yours completely
I feel so deeply
You're my first thought every day
And I want it that way
My life is for you
And I adore you
I love you more every day
And I want it that way
No goodbyes
Ain't nothing but a heartache
No more lies
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
I want it that way
My heart is on fire
Such a strong desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Chance the Rapper
You are my fire (
Flamin' hot nachos?
The one desire (
They made the original hot-hot-hot?
Believe when I say
I want it that-that-that way
Backstreet Boys
Ooh, hot stuff all over my nachos
Walkin' like a taco, drivin' over potholes (
Tell me why
Hotter than a pot roast, fingers on my hot chips
Red-handed, c'mon, man, now I'ma need some chopsticks (
Tell me why
Before I leave the house, man, I'ma need another outfit
Flyer than a maggot on a wall inside a cockpit
Speaking of desire, man, you preachin' to the choir, man
My tongue is doin' fine, but the roof is on fire
Backstreet Boys
, &
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
The original, now it's hot

Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
Days all feel the same, still numb from you
First step off of this plane, I knew
I suffocate without you, heart beats for two
It was good
What we had
If it was paradise
Can somebody take me back?
And it hurts
Looking back
If this is for the best
Then tell me why it hurts so bad
Don't let go when the daylight's gone
'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn
I breathe, oh
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs
When I hate the things that I've become
I breathe, oh

You fill me up 'til you're empty
I took too much and you let me
We've been down all these roads before
And what we found don't live there anymore
It's dark, it's cold
If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold
Maybe you'd be happier with someone else
Maybe loving me's the reason you can't love yourself
Before I turn your heart into a ghost town
Show me everything we built so I can tear it all down
Down, down, down, down
You know I'll stay, don't you tempt mе
But all this weight is getting heavy
Been holding up what wasn't mеant to stand
I turned this love into a wasteland
It's dark, it's cold
If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold

Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces
Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got
Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you
Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

There's nothing colder than your shoulder
When you're dragging me along like you do, like you do
And then you switch up with no warnin'
And you kiss me like you want it, how rude, how rude
But I kinda like it anyways
I don't mind if this is gonna take a million days
I know you'll come around to me eventually
If you sit back, relax, and join my company, my company
Once you know what my love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right, you can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream, taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies, 'cause it feels so
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know
My love is so mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know
My little hard-to-get baby
I wanna give you the world
Not saying you gotta chase me
But I wouldn't mind it
If you gave me just a little bit
Of something we can work it with
But all you do is push me out

I'd never met you, but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're
In your head right now
While your world is spinning out
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me slow it down

Oh, I remember how you were
You were every shade of perfect
And then the colors blurred
And you'll never love me like you did
You'll never love, you'll never love me like you did
And I see your ghost from time to time
When I'm driving through the Rockies
And I feel this little knife in my heart
And it bleeds me out
Don't wanna love, I don't wanna love you now
Oh, how come all the best things fall apart?
And it startеd pretty slowly
Oh, when you asked about thе old me
"Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone?" Oh, I don't know
I think I left him somewhere I no longer go
And I watch you run away now
From all the lovely things we hate now
Where did we go? Where did we go? Oh, I don't know
But I know it feels like somewhere far away from home
And it's falling into pieces
No, there's not a way that we can stop this now
One thousand miles an hour, we're driving off the edge
And, darling, now there's nothing left
And it started out so slowly

Momma, I'm missing home
And California's getting colder
And colder, and colder
I miss you
And, Momma, I'm getting old
Does that mean you're getting older
And older, and older?
I miss you
Momma, don't you know
There's nothing to be sorry about?
I'm so proud of all you've done
Take me down your old street
Tell me your memories of when you were young and when you fell in love
Drive me through the country
Tell me your story and you can play all of your favorite songs
'Cause I'm gonna need this
When I'm holding pictures of you and that's all that I've got left
All that I've got left
All that I've got left
Lately, it's getting hard
I've started looking like my father
And it makes me cry a little bit
'Cause he really should've made it big
'Cause, damn, he's good at everything
And everything I am's because of you
I'm a man because of you

I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
But it's good to see your face
And I really hope you're doin' well
I hope you're doin' well
She was runnin' late for dinner, South side of town
Left the phone a little bitter, but it's cool for now
Far from perfect for each other, but we're workin' it out, I suppose
Now I'm waiting at the diner, looking traumatized
'Cause you walk up to the table with an order of fries
And I know ya, yes, I know ya, used to love you
And I said
I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
It's good to see your face
And I really hope you're doin' well
I hope you're doin' well
I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
I wish that I could stay
And talk at the bar all by ourselves
But I'm here for someone else

I tried to hide it through the silence while I played along
I'm welling up behind my eyelids when I'm holding on
To the rage, so badly I hate him
And I wish that all of—
Nah, nah, nah, that doesn't feel right
Maybe, uh, speed it up
Yeah, that's nice
I really hate the way you think that you can get away
By blaming all your stupid problems on your mental state
I'm tired of burnt-out lies, oh
Ooh
You think you know me, but you hardly even know yourself
I'd bite my tongue and let you think I only wish you well
I don't, I know you know it
Ooh
And I'm tired of letting someone get the bеst of me, so go ahead and
Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin somеone else's life
Cry, cry
Go bug somebody else, so I can sleep at night

He was a stranger
He walked in looking for danger
When he stares at you
He can chain you down and make you fall in love
Heaven knows, yeah
They made him out of fire and roses
With an attitude
But he's sweet enough to put him on your tongue
He can be everything you've ever dreamed
Ooh, Mr. Electric Blue
I wanna dance like you
How did you get so cool?
And, oh, you got electric soul
You lеt the good times roll
Mr. Electric Bluе
They say that he fell from space
Or some supernatural place
Mr. Electric Blue
I know I believe in you

Why would I want to fly
Be on the last red eye
Talkin' to your voice, only hearing noise
Oh, it's not enough
All of the nights I spent
Drownin' my discontent
Wasting me away, everything has changed
Now that I found us
And it feels like home
Darling, if you don't mind
I'll take your hand tonight
We could just slow down time
Let me adore you
And from the moment I looked in those dark brown eyes
I can't remember life
Before you
Why would I want to go?
Now that you're all I know
Smilin' under stars
Playin' chasin' cars
Somethin' 'bout the art of music in the dark

You're the lump in my throat
You're the reason I choke
On the words that I wish I had said
You're the feeling of home
Smell of smoke on my coat
Miss you over, and over again
Everybody says I'll survive, I'll be fine
But they don't know what it's like
If it doesn't wake you up
In a violent sweat and steal your breath
If it doesn't make a cut
That just won't close, it wasn't love
So let me go
Did you learn how to drive?
Are you somewhere tonight
With someone tryna paint over me?
Oh, it hurts but it should
It hurts but it's good
'Causе the best kinda love scars' deep

I remember we were only sixteen at the time
We stole your daddy's car the day you learned to drive
You nearly killed us both a half mile down the road
Yeah, we were upside down and moving in slow motion
We're just floating
So wild and free
And it all made sense to me
If I'm gonna die a young American
And this was the final night we'd ever have again
I'd be just fine as long as I'm wherever you are
'Causе you stole my young, American heart
Wеll, it's been a long two years since you have left the country
And now, you and I, we're living in some crazy times
And I get so scared we'll never make it through our twenties
And we'll lose it all for nothing, nothing
If I'm gonna die a young American
And this was the final night we'd ever have again
I'd be just fine as long as I'm wherever you are
'Cause you stole my young, American heart

Ooh, la, la, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la
When you pull me in and you hold me close
And you say all kinds of crazy things that make me wanna stay in your arms
You're a charm, I'm in love
But you don't care when I'm falling down, slowly burning out
And the lights, and crowds, and cameras in my face are getting louder
And I need some time
You say, "Why?"
Don't you see that
Lately (
I've been tryna—
), I've been fading? (
I've been tryna—
I can't breathe inside this cage
You took the man in me
You took his sanity
You stole the last of any light inside his eyes
You really made me bleed
Blood on these ivory keys
You killed the only part of me I еver liked

I started driving through the hills, told me to come and get you
No words convey the way it felt for me to finally hold you
In my arms just long enough to know
Know every word you're gonna say before you even think it
But, somehow, every joke you make is funnier each time around
Your laugh is such a perfect sound
These butterflies lived a million lives to say
I swear I've known you longer than
Forever and a day
A day
Forever and ever and a day
A day
Forеver and a day
I bet we alrеady knew our names before we met each other
I bet we've sailed the Milky Way, walked on the Sun together
How could I forget those emerald eyes?
They took me by surprise, but suddenly
I missed your face, I knew that smile from miles away
I knew that I have loved you

Bi-di-bum-bum-bum
Do-do, do, do-do
Ba-da-ba-da-bum
I took a trip to Italy
I'm looking for a little peace
And there you go, right down the road
So beautiful
Flowers in your braided hair
Calvin Klein underwear
Hanging out your jeans, you're such a tease
So beautiful
I just need your number
So if you're alone
I wanna be the one you call
When you need anything, anything at all
I wanna be the name you scream
When you need anything

Benson Boone revisits a bygone relationship in his  soul rock anthem “Reminds Me Of You.”
You got a million different pairs of underwear
Spread out on my couch 'cause you left 'em there
You got a couple little candles in my living room
I still light at night just to set the mood
A box of written letters on my nightstand
With a Polaroid picture of your chest
And when I'm driving my car to the overlook spot
I can smell your perfume in the vents
And, ooh, what do I do?
What do I do?
When every damn thing reminds me of you
Reminds me of you
When every damn thing reminds me of you
Reminds me of you
Whеn every damn thing reminds mе of—
Flip phones, Listerine
Tired eyes and drinking coffee
I see you everywhere the wind blows
Our handprints settled in on the windows
Cars, trains, T-shirt stains
Even places I ain't ever been
No, I ain't ever been

Didn't know how much I would love Santa Barbara
Never driven up, but I know that it's gotta be so beautiful
If that's where you were born
Long brown hair that your mom doesn't like
You got a moon tattoo that you don't even hide
You're so unusual
Haven't met someone like you before
Wanna be that guy that's makin' it hard for you to sleep at night
I want you to call me when it's gettin' late
You could tell me anything
From time to time, you give me the smallest look
Behind your eyes, and, baby, it's almost like you need someone
I promise I can be someone
From night to night, it's takin' you longer
When you say, "Goodbye," and, baby, it's almost like you need someone
I promise I can be someone
I've been carried away tryin' to get inside your brain
And what do you know? Do you live alone?
And do you pray?
And do you believe there is a life
Where it's just you and me and I?
We don't need a way, we don't need a sign
It's only you and me and I

Brand-new apartment, we sat on the floor
A blow-up mattress and some plastic forks
Our clothes on the counter, keys in the door
You're all that I wanted, never been so sure
Chances are
The future will take us places that we can't imagine yet
And chances are
Yours is the face I could never forget
But suddenly nothing is the way that it was
Is this what it feels like to love someone?
Don't know what you had until it's gone
Is this what it feels like to love someonе?
Love someone, lovе someone
Empty apartment, I'm sat on the floor
A blow-up mattress and a plastic fork
Fighting the flashbacks that creep through the door
I stare at the ceiling and I try to ignore
Chances are
We're gonna tell ourselves this is how it's supposed to be
And chances are
This isn't the last time I'll dance with your memory

Wait for me right down Old Owen Road
It's been a while, these streets are overgrown
I'm glad to see your eyes ain't changed at all
They always looked a little greener in the fall
Kiss me, kiss me slowly
Like you did when we were young
And hold me like you know me
Like the old days, walk me home
Let's go on a walk, how have you been?
Did that fancy college art school let you in?
Well, damnit, they'd be crazy if they never saw in you
What I failed to see at seventeen, I must've missed it too
Oh, kiss me, kiss me slowly
Like you did when we were young
And hold me like you know me
Like the old days, take me home

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
, mm-mm

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on
Survivor
just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

Oh, mm-mm
I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh
"Call me when you're there"
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'"
So now, she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair
Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change , you could borrow
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby
Birds of a feather, we should stick together
, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
I said you
You were the love of my life
The love of my life
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you
Then you tried to break mine
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me
Then you moved on immediately
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
When I said you
You  were the love of my life
The love of my life

Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

Khalid
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (
Found
But you never go away (
Never go away
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
with Khalid
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
with Billie Eilish
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
Hmm
Well, good things don't last
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
f "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

Billie
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Mehki Raine
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes
But now she's got to get to class
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say
Aww
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away
Hahahahahahahaha
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys"
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
Yay
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

“my future” portrays Billie reflecting on her past and her future, and her change in style from a more melancholic sound, towards a happier, more optimistic one.
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I , I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
I know supposedly I'm lonely now
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone
But aren't I someone?
I'd  like to be your answer
'Cause you're so handsome

My Lucifer is lonely
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely

Mind
Mind
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
, mm-mm

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on
Survivor
just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

Oh, mm-mm
I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh
"Call me when you're there"
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'"
So now, she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair
Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change , you could borrow
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby
Birds of a feather, we should stick together
, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
I said you
You were the love of my life
The love of my life
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you
Then you tried to break mine
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me
Then you moved on immediately
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
When I said you
You  were the love of my life
The love of my life

Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

Khalid
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (
Found
But you never go away (
Never go away
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
with Khalid
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
with Billie Eilish
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
Hmm
Well, good things don't last
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
f "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

Billie
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Mehki Raine
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me

I miss you, I miss you
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
I miss you, miss you
I miss you, miss you
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating
Say it ain't so,
I will not go
Turn the lights off
, carry me home
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feelin' right
We started makin' out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV
with Tom DeLonge
away from me
Nobody likes you when you're
twenty-three
And are still more amused by
TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy
with Tom DeLonge
up on me
Nobody likes you when you're
twenty-three
And are still more amused by
prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

A popular song by Blink-182 describing a young boy’s suicide note. It’s a break from their usual light-hearted material, but the end is still life affirming as he decides not to go through with it.
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

Strangers, from strangers into brothers
From brothers into strangers once again
We saw the whole world, but I couldn't see the meaning
I couldn't even recognize my friends
Older, but nothing's any different
Right now feels the same, I wonder why
I wish they told us, it shouldn't take a sickness
Or airplanes falling out the sky
Do I have to die to hear you miss me?
Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?
I don't wanna act like there's tomorrow
I don't wanna wait to do this one more time
One morе time
One more
Onе more time
One more time
I miss you, took time, but I admit it
It still hurts even after all these years
And I know that next time ain't always gonna happen
I gotta say "I love you" while we're here

Get ready for action!
I got no regret right now
The air is so cold and low
Let me go in her room
I wanna take off her clothes
Show me the way to bed
Show me the way you move
Fuck it, it's such a blur
I love all the things you do
Mark Hoppus
Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear
Our breathing's got too loud
Show me the bedroom floor
Show me the bathroom mirror
We're taking this way too slow
Take me away from here

It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down
The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short,
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now
And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone, I won't come back

In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat
Let's go, don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

“Stay Together For the Kids” is written from the point of view of a child with divorced parents. Dual vocalists Tom Delonge and Mark Hoppus were growing up when both their parents divorced.
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time,
you gave it all away
It was mine
, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants
Then why's there so much pain?

I ain't that cool, a little fucked in the head
They'll be hangin' me quick when I'm back from the dead
Get the rope, get the rope
Get the rope, get the rope
I'm a punk rock kid, I came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it away, so
I fucked her in church
Don't you know? Don't you know?
Don't you know? Yeah, don't you know?
They say, "You're not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp, no way"
Mark Hoppus
No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at thе mess we started
Oh no, I lеave the broken hearts this way (
This way
Whatcha say? (
Whatcha say?
) Wanna play?
Yeah, don't be fooled, I'm only lettin' you down
They pursued me on foot, but I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost, like a ghost
Like a ghost, like a ghost
The seats of my car are filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eye, a little blood on my shirt
Let's hit the road, hit the road
Hit the road, hit the road
I know there's a special place in hell
That my friends and I know well
There's a perfect place to go
When it's time to lose control

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands, they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you, all night, always
And I'll miss your laugh, your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you tell me
I'm so sick of fights, I hate them
Let's start this again, for real
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
I'm not coming home
Mark Hoppus
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
I'm not coming home

I said, "Settle down, settle down, everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor"
She said, "No, I'm not, no, I'm not, no, I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door"
She's a-a-a-antisocial, a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-and she's an angel, yeah
Hoppus
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
She said "Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt,
and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind, oh yeah
Matt Skiba
We all need something to live for
, oh yeah
We all need something to live for
She said, I let her down, let her down, I no longer dream
Of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all, "You make me want to scream"
And threw herself on the floor

It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, I could never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this, I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel if I should choose to go?
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me?
Another guy, you think he'd wanna fight me?
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
I heard it once, I'm sure I've heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say, "You've got to turn your back and run, now"
"Come on, son, you haven't got a chance now"
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

Mark Hoppus
I wanna fuck a dog in the ass,
he wants to
Fuck a dog in the ass
I wanna fuck a dog
, that's right kids
I tried to fuck your mom in the ass, tried to fuck your dad in the ass
Could only find the dog and his ass
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna
Fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna fuck a dog
Mark Hoppus
I tried to fuck a fucking pirate in the ass,
arr, me and me
First mate,
ya scurvy cur!
Tried to fuck a fucking pirate
But I found the dog,
arr, that was no pirate, man
That was thy own sister!
It's a Mexican pirate
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna
Fuck a dog in the ass, wanna fuck a fucking dog
Fuck you!

Got a lotta heartache
, he's a fuckin' weasel
His issues make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions you do with your pigtails
What a nice creation, worth another night in jail
He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with Mom and trying on his father's tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag
So all you little ladies, be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe, I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heartache, he's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl will choose the guy that makes you wanna kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy that took her and ran away, and

“The Rock Show” explores the thoughts and behavior of a teenage punk-rocker who goes to the Vans Warped Tour, and subsequently falls in love with a girl there.
Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there
She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation

Hey Mom, there's something in the backroom
Hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories, as if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb
What if people knew that these were real?
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say, "What you hear is all hearsay"
Wish someone would tell me what was right
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you
I am still a skeptic, yes, you know me
Been best friends and will be 'til we die
I got an injection of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies, alright

Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because
, yeah, just because
And my girlfriend likes UL and DHC
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer
And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation
And I see her pretty face, it takes me away to a better place, and
Mark Hoppus
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything,
everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything,
everything's gonna be fine

Travis Barker
The drops of rain, they fall all over
This awkward silence makes me crazy
The glow inside burns light upon her
I'll try to kiss you if you let me
This can't be the end
Tidal waves, they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, it gets me so
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, it gets me so
Travis Barker
Your vows of silence fall all over
The look in your eyes makes me crazy
I feel the darkness break upon her
I'll take you over if you let me
You did this

Blame it, blame it on my youth
I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance
It's too late
Can you forgive me now?
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

Is it better?
Is it better now?
Are we better?
Are we better now?
Is it better?
Is it better now?
Are we better?
Are we better now?
Mark Hoppus
All we needed was your lifeline
We swore we'd be better than the last time
Don't leave, tell me that you're all right
I'm not the generational divide

Hey, kid, don't quit your daydream yet
I know you feel locked out in the cold
Seems like you’re lost and alone
Hey, kid, don't listen to your head
It only fills you with dread and with doubt
Left looking for an easy way out
I know you don't know
Oh no, you don’t know
I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
Walls of isolation inside of my pain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change
I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
All of this frustration inside of my brain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change
Some nights, you call for the jaws of life
To pull you out of the crash
A forgotten ghost from your past
When enough doesn't cut it
When you're backed up against a wall
Is it the life that you wanted
When you could never have it all?

She's a girl dressed in black from another world
Lives and breathes like a girl from another world
She don't know my name
She don't have the time of day
Celebrate, medicate 'til we numb the pain
In the sun‚ it's still dark‚ like it always rains
She don't feel the same
She don't have the time of day
And I wait‚ and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait‚ and I wait
And I wait for her
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait‚ and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you

I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you
A little drunk, waiting on your phone call
A little numb, maybe I can't feel at all
You stitch me up but you can’t stop me bleeding out
I'm better when I'm broken
I love you, but I hate you when you're with someone else
And I want you wrapped around me, but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house, but you don't live there anymore
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don’t really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now
Won't you say something?
Won’t you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

I miss you, I miss you
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
I miss you, miss you
I miss you, miss you
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating
Say it ain't so,
I will not go
Turn the lights off
, carry me home
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feelin' right
We started makin' out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV
with Tom DeLonge
away from me
Nobody likes you when you're
twenty-three
And are still more amused by
TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy
with Tom DeLonge
up on me
Nobody likes you when you're
twenty-three
And are still more amused by
prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

A popular song by Blink-182 describing a young boy’s suicide note. It’s a break from their usual light-hearted material, but the end is still life affirming as he decides not to go through with it.
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

Strangers, from strangers into brothers
From brothers into strangers once again
We saw the whole world, but I couldn't see the meaning
I couldn't even recognize my friends
Older, but nothing's any different
Right now feels the same, I wonder why
I wish they told us, it shouldn't take a sickness
Or airplanes falling out the sky
Do I have to die to hear you miss me?
Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?
I don't wanna act like there's tomorrow
I don't wanna wait to do this one more time
One morе time
One more
Onе more time
One more time
I miss you, took time, but I admit it
It still hurts even after all these years
And I know that next time ain't always gonna happen
I gotta say "I love you" while we're here

Get ready for action!
I got no regret right now
The air is so cold and low
Let me go in her room
I wanna take off her clothes
Show me the way to bed
Show me the way you move
Fuck it, it's such a blur
I love all the things you do
Mark Hoppus
Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear
Our breathing's got too loud
Show me the bedroom floor
Show me the bathroom mirror
We're taking this way too slow
Take me away from here

It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down
The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short,
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now
And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone, I won't come back

In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat
Let's go, don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

“Stay Together For the Kids” is written from the point of view of a child with divorced parents. Dual vocalists Tom Delonge and Mark Hoppus were growing up when both their parents divorced.
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time,
you gave it all away
It was mine
, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants
Then why's there so much pain?

I ain't that cool, a little fucked in the head
They'll be hangin' me quick when I'm back from the dead
Get the rope, get the rope
Get the rope, get the rope
I'm a punk rock kid, I came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it away, so
I fucked her in church
Don't you know? Don't you know?
Don't you know? Yeah, don't you know?
They say, "You're not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp, no way"
Mark Hoppus
No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at thе mess we started
Oh no, I lеave the broken hearts this way (
This way
Whatcha say? (
Whatcha say?
) Wanna play?
Yeah, don't be fooled, I'm only lettin' you down
They pursued me on foot, but I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost, like a ghost
Like a ghost, like a ghost
The seats of my car are filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eye, a little blood on my shirt
Let's hit the road, hit the road
Hit the road, hit the road
I know there's a special place in hell
That my friends and I know well
There's a perfect place to go
When it's time to lose control

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands, they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you, all night, always
And I'll miss your laugh, your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you tell me
I'm so sick of fights, I hate them
Let's start this again, for real
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
I'm not coming home
Mark Hoppus
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
I'm not coming home

I said, "Settle down, settle down, everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor"
She said, "No, I'm not, no, I'm not, no, I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door"
She's a-a-a-antisocial, a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-and she's an angel, yeah
Hoppus
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
She said "Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt,
and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind, oh yeah
Matt Skiba
We all need something to live for
, oh yeah
We all need something to live for
She said, I let her down, let her down, I no longer dream
Of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all, "You make me want to scream"
And threw herself on the floor

It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, I could never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this, I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel if I should choose to go?
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me?
Another guy, you think he'd wanna fight me?
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
I heard it once, I'm sure I've heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say, "You've got to turn your back and run, now"
"Come on, son, you haven't got a chance now"
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

Mark Hoppus
I wanna fuck a dog in the ass,
he wants to
Fuck a dog in the ass
I wanna fuck a dog
, that's right kids
I tried to fuck your mom in the ass, tried to fuck your dad in the ass
Could only find the dog and his ass
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna
Fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna fuck a dog
Mark Hoppus
I tried to fuck a fucking pirate in the ass,
arr, me and me
First mate,
ya scurvy cur!
Tried to fuck a fucking pirate
But I found the dog,
arr, that was no pirate, man
That was thy own sister!
It's a Mexican pirate
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna
Fuck a dog in the ass, wanna fuck a fucking dog
Fuck you!

Got a lotta heartache
, he's a fuckin' weasel
His issues make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions you do with your pigtails
What a nice creation, worth another night in jail
He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with Mom and trying on his father's tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag
So all you little ladies, be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe, I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heartache, he's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl will choose the guy that makes you wanna kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy that took her and ran away, and

“The Rock Show” explores the thoughts and behavior of a teenage punk-rocker who goes to the Vans Warped Tour, and subsequently falls in love with a girl there.
Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there
She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation

Hey Mom, there's something in the backroom
Hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories, as if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb
What if people knew that these were real?
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say, "What you hear is all hearsay"
Wish someone would tell me what was right
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you
I am still a skeptic, yes, you know me
Been best friends and will be 'til we die
I got an injection of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies, alright

Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because
, yeah, just because
And my girlfriend likes UL and DHC
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in,
when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free
Woah, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
Yeah, you give love a bad name
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for faith-departed
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
It's my life, it's now or never
But I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
Yeah, this is for ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's gettin' harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, gotta make your own breaks
It's my life, and  it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

It's all the same, only the names will change
Every day it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted  dead or alive
Wanted  dead or alive
Oh, and I ride

This Romeo is bleedin'
, but you can't see his blood
It's nothin' but some feelin's that this old dog kicked up
It's been rainin' since you left me, now I'm drownin' in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter, but without you, I give up
I can't sing a love song like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore, but baby, that's just me
Yeah, I will love you, baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I love you
Always
Now your pictures that you left behind are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry, one that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair, to touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take's on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true

I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I pray to God you'll give me one more chance, girl
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
Riche Sambora
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
And baby, you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valen
tine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine, woah

On the street where you live
They're made of lipstick, plastic, and paint
A touch of sable in their eyes
All your life all you've asked
When's your daddy gonna talk to you?
But you were livin' in another world
Tryna get a message through
No one heard a single word you said
They shoulda seen it in your eyes
What was goin' 'round your head
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Take a line every night, guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, callin' for a wild time
So you sit home alone, 'cause there's nothin' left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you

Shoulda seen it coming when the roses died
Shoulda seen the end of summer in your eyes
Shoulda listened when you said goodnight
You really meant goodbye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees and think you're standin' tall
But only fools are know-it-alls and I played that fool for you
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby
If the love that I've got for you's gone
And if the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancin' at the masquerade?
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades and some things never change

I was walkin' around, just a face in the crowd
Tryna keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown
Wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Whose singin' old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare these days
She came lookin' for some shelter
With a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's tryna be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples
And all the wannabes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothin' to hold on to but these days
These days the stars ain't out of reach
These days there ain't a ladder on the streets
On, no, no, these days are fast, nothin' lasts
In this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
I ain't got a fever, got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money, but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms, count 'em, one, two, three
First, you need
Then you bleed
And when you're on your knees
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug
Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

It's hard for me to say the things I wanna say sometimes
There's no one here but you and me and that broken old street light
Lock the doors, we'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
are these five words tonight
Thank you for lovin' me
For bein' my eyes when I couldn't see
For partin' my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for lovin' me
Thank you for lovin' me
I never knew I had a dream until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes, the sky's a different blue
Cross my heart, I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe that you believed my lies
Thank you for lovin' me
For bein' my eyes when I couldn't see
For partin' my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for lovin' me
Thank you for lovin' me

Hey, man, I'm alive
I'm taking each day and night at a time
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
Hey my name is Jim, where did I go wrong?
My life's a bargain basement and all the good shit's gone
Just can't hold a job, where do I belong?
Been sleeping in my car, my dreams moved on
My name is Billie Jean, my love is bought and sold
I'm only sixteen, I feel a hundred years old
My foster daddy went, took my innocence away
The street life ain't much better, but at least I'm getting paid
And Tuesday just might go my way
Can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive
Hey, man, I'm alive
I'm taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man, gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night

Mother, mother, tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won
Father, father, please believe me
I am layin' down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me
Forgive your wayward son
Mother, mother
Please believe me
And it's hard to hold on when there's no one to lean on
You know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Don't you let your love turn to hate
Now we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith

As I sit in this smoky room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Rememberin' when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat, baby
Remember how we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
Remember days of skippin' school
Racin' cars and bein' cool
With a six-pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me, we had a fight
But the band, they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong

Why you wanna tell me how to live my life?
And who are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference 'tween a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shinin' like a diamond, rollin' with the dice
Standin' on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say have a nice day
Have a nice day
Take a look around you, nothin's what it seems
We're livin' in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helpin' hand
Of anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Lookin' for forgiveness and what's left to believe

Shot through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love
Would you be content to see me cryin'?
After all those little games you put me through
After all I've done for you, you're lyin'
Wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth?
Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're gonna take a fall?
I gave you everything
Now here's the curtain call
And I'm shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark
Through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love
Now you've come back here to say you're sorry, hah!
I just don't know who you're talkin' to
It could be the man I used to be, girl
I've grown up and now I'm over you

If you could see inside my heart
Then you would understand
I'd never mean to hurt you
Baby, I'm not that kind of man
I might not say I'm sorry
Yeah, I might talk tough sometimes
And I might forget the little things
Or keep you hangin' on the line
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
Into the fire, we cry
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you

Two, three, four!
Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay
But we got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothin' when I'm by your side
We got somethin' that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride
My heart beats like a drum
Flesh to flesh, one to one
And I'll never let go 'cause there's somethin' I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
Baby, I was made to be your man
We got somethin' to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet He must've had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because
My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess, I still believe
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Mmm, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, baby
Oops, I did it again,
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
, oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love, that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
You see, my problem is this
I'm dreamin' away
Wishin' that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

Baby, can't you see I'm callin'?
A guy like you should wear a warnin'
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's gettin' late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's takin' over me

It's Britney, bitch
I see you
And I just wanna dance with you
Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room
We can get down
Like there's no one around
We keep on rocking
We keep on rocking
Cameras are flashing
While we're dirty dancing
They keep watching
Keep watching,
feels like the crowd is saying
Gimme, gimme , gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme , gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme , gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme , gimme
Gimme, gimme

But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said, "I want your body now"
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said, "I want your body now"
Would you hold it against me?
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out, 'cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it, you notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good
-ish
, sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waiting for?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

“I Wanna Go” is the third single from Femme Fatale, released on June 13, 2011.
Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out
Shame on me
To need release
Un-un-uncontrollably
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind, woah
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind, woah
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the bla-blanket
When the light's out

You wanna?
You wanna?
You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
You want a Maserati? You better work, bitch
You want a Lamborghini? Sip martinis?
Look hot in a bikini?
You better work, bitch
You wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion?
Party in France?
You better work, bitch
You better work, bitch, you better work, bitch
You better work, bitch
Now get to work, bitch
Now get to work, bitch
Bring it on, ring the alarm
Don't stop now, just be the champion
Work it hard like it's your profession
Watch out now, 'cause here it comes

La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
Oh, baby, baby, have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom? Is she smoking up outside? (
Oh, baby, baby, does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'ma buy her? Do you know just what she likes? (
Oh, oh, tell me, have you seen her?
'Cause I'm so, oh, I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gon' go
Can somebody take me home?
Ha-ha, hee-hee, ha-ha, ho
Love me, hate me, say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la

Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time
I don't wanna be so shy, uh-oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

This is a story about a girl named Lucky
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say
"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But, mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh-oh, I know, oh
Should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first (
Oh, oh
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (
Call the shots
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot
when I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

Friday
I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowin' up to the ceiling, we burnin' bright when we cut the light
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always sayin', "Little girl, don't step into the club"
Well, I'm just tryna find out why, 'cause dancing's what I love, yeah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it , get it, get it, woah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, uh
I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talkin', feel like dancin' when I see this guy
What's practical? What's logical? What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancin' there
I'm a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you
I won't deny it, I'm not tryna hide it

Tonight
I just wanna take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right
Players
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all tryna do?
24-karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Look out, uh
Pop-pop, it's show time , show time
Guess who's back again?
Oh, they don't know?  Oh, they don't know?
I bet they know as soon as we walk in
Wearin' Cuban links , designer minks
Inglewood's finest shoes
Don't look too hard, might hurt yourself
Known to give the color red the blues
Woo, shit
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
So many pretty girls around me and they wakin' up the rocket
Why you mad? Fix your face, ain't my fault they all be jockin'
Players only, come on

Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

Drop top Porsche , Rollie on my wrist
Diamonds up and down my chain
Cardi B, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook
My big fat ass got all them boys hooked
Went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands
Bruno sang to me while I do my money dance like
Ayy, flexin' on the 'Gram like
Ayy, hit the Lil Jon
Okay , okay
Oh, yeah, we drippin' in finesse and gettin' paid, ow
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight, I'm gonna show you off
When I walk in with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence or blame it on your measurements
Shut the shit down on sight
That's right

Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us, all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Ooh, I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
I'll unzip the back and watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door
'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing
Sayin', "There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of somethin' they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

Mark Ronson
One, two, one, two, three
Aw, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimmin' in your water's somethin' spiritual
I'm born again every time you spend the night, —ight
'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked outta heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked outta heaven
For too long
For too long

Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had ya eyes wide open, uh, why were they open?
Gave you all I had, and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what ya don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya , oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no-oh-oh-oh

Megan Vick for Billboard explained the meaning of the song:
The song is about Bruno professing “his love for a beautiful girl who occupies his dreams”.
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful, uh
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah

Oh, thinkin' about our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more
Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in Heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
Isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven
Oh, once in your life, you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh, there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way

When it's love you give
I'll be a man of good faith
Then in love you'll live
I'll make a stand, I won't break
I'll be the rock you can build on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold
When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong
Then there's a reason why
I'll prove to you we belong
I'll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain
Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold, be the one you want
The one you need
Cause when it's all for one, it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
To really love a woman - Let her hold you
'Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the Five and Dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
Should've known we'd never get far
Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life
Hey!
Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Look into my eyes, you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
And when you find me there, you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do, I do it for you
Look into your heart, you will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do, I do it for you
Oh, yeah
There's no love like your love
And no other could give more love
There's nowhere unless you're there
All the time, all the way, yeah

She says her love for me could never die
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I
Oh, but her love is cold
Wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cause
When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you
'Cause when the feeling's right, I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you
She's got a heart of gold, she'd never let me down
But you're the one that always turns me on, you keep me comin' 'round
I know her love is true
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you
I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch

Still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss and it's gettin' better baby
No one can better this
Still holdin' on, you're still the one
First time our eyes met the same feeling I get
Only feels much stronger, I wanna love you longer
You still turn the fire on
So if you're feelin' lonely, don't
You're the only one I ever want
I only wanna make it good
So if I love you a little more than I should
Please forgive me, I know not what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do
Please believe me, every word I say is true
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Still feels like our best times are together
Feels like the first touch
We're still gettin' closer baby
Can't get close enough
I'm still holdin' on, you're still number one
I remember the smell of your skin
I remember everything
I remember all your moves, I remember you
I remember the night, you know I still do

Bryan Adams
I finally found someone
Who knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one
Who makes me feel complete
It started over coffee
We started out as friends
It's funny how from simple things
The best things begin
This time is different
la la la la
It's all because of you
la la la la
It's better than it's ever been
'Cause
we can talk it through
My favorite line
Was "Can I call you sometime?"
It's all you had to say
take my breath away
, Barbra Streisand,
Bryan Adams
This is it
Oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
'Cause whatever I do
it's just got to be you
My life has just begun, I finally found someone
Ooooh, someone
I finally found someone
Ooooh

I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone, we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart
You say it's easy, but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart
Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go, as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart
I see you on the street some other time
And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart
Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go, as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

When you love someone, you'll do anything
You'll do all the crazy things that you can't explain
You'll shoot the moon, put out the sun
When you love someone
You'll deny the truth, believe a lie
There'll be times that you'll believe you could really fly
But your lonely nights have just begun
When you love someone
When you love someone, you'll feel it deep inside
And nothing else could ever change your mind
When you want someone, when you need someone
When you love someone
When you love someone, you'll sacrifice
You'd give it everything you got and you won't think twice
You'd risk it all, no matter what may come
When you love someone

When you're gone
I've been wandering around the house all night
Wondering what the hell to do
Yeah, I'm trying to concentrate
But all I can think of is you
Well, the phone don't ring 'cause my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on 'cause the radio's playing
Songs that remind me of you
Bryan Adams
Baby, when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Baby, when you're gone
Yeah

Written by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance.
Drivin' home this evenin'
Coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this boy believin'
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt, Yeah
Well, I heard it on the street
I heard you might've found somebody new, Yeah
Well, who is he, baby?
Who is he and tell me what he means to you? Oh, yeah
I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go
Now it cuts like a knife!
But it feels so right
Yeah, it cuts like a knife
Oh, but it feels so right
There's times I've been mistaken
There's times I thought I'd been misunderstood, Ooh, yeah
So wait a minute, darlin'
Can't you see we did the best we could?
Ooh, we could

Yeah, yeah
Here I am, this is me
There's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be
Here I am, it's just me and you
Tonight we make our dreams come true
It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
Here I am
Here I am
Here we are, we've just begun
And after all this time, our time has come
Yeah, here we are, still goin' strong
Right here in the place where we belong
Oh, it's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you

Sound the bugle now, play it just for me
As the seasons change, remember how I used to be
Now I can't go on, I can't even start
I got nothing left, just an empty heart
I'm a soldier, wounded so I must give up the fight
There's nothing more for me, lead me away
Or leave me lying here
Sound the bugle now, tell them I don't care
There's not a road I know that leads to anywhere
Without a light, I fear that I will stumble in the dark
Lay right down, decide not to go on
Then from on high, somewhere in the distance
There's a voice that calls, "Remember who you are
If you lose yourself, your courage soon will follow
So be strong tonight, remember who you are"
Yeah, you're a soldier now, fighting in a battle
To be free once more
Yeah, that's worth fighting for

I hear the wind call my name
The sound that leads me home again
It sparks up the fire, a flame that still burns
To you I will always return
I know the road is long but where you are is home
Wherever you stay, I'll find the way
I'll run like the river, I'll follow the sun
I fly like an eagle to where I belong
I can't stand the distance, I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you, yes, I'm on my way home
And now I know it's true
My every road leads to you
And in the hour of darkness
Your light gets me through
You run like the river, you shine like the sun
You fly like an eagle
Yeah, you are the one
I've seen every sunset
And with all that I've learned
Oh, it's to you I will always, always return

Here I am, this is me
I come into this world so wild and free
Here I am, so young and strong
Right here in the place where I belong
It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
It's a new day in a new land
And it's waiting for me
Here I am
Oh, it's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
Yeah, it's a new day in a new land
And it's waiting for me
Here I am

I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms
Layin', we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde, huh
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Hey!
Now nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe
And do you mind if I steal a kiss?
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here
Just wanna feel it from you
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

Ah-ooh, ooh, ah-ooh
I want you to breathe me in
Let me be your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition, no fear
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?
Hit me harder again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer again
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh

Are you drunk enough
Not to judge what I'm doin’?
Are you high enough
To excuse that I'm ruined? 'Cause I’m ruined
Is it late enough
For you to come and stay over?
'Cause we're free to love
So tease me, ooh

I make no promises, I can't do golden rings

Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything (

Your everything tonight, uh
Is it loud enough?
’Cause my body is callin' for ya, callin’ for ya
I need someone
To do the things that I do, mhm
I'm heatin' up
Energy's takin’ control
I'm speedin' up
My heartbeat's dancin' alone

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
Summer

I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
Got L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci
Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
They deserve Whammys, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her

You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way
We say nothin' more than we need
I say, "Your place" when we leave
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothin' left
Hey, I've been wantin' to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you cryin'
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
, ay
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Something in you-ou-ou
Lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

Look at what you've done
Stand still, fallin' away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?
Now I'm holdin' on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day, I'll be watching you
Oh-ah, oh-ah
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh-ah
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside, oh-ah
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh-ah
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love
I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there, but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushin' out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now
So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

I don't really care if your tears fall down your face
You know you play the victim every time
I know you gettin' turnt every night, oh yeah
Your girls ain't shit, tryna get me off your mind
The same ones who be hittin' up my line
They're not your friends
I need you to know that
We ain't ever gonna go back
This time, it got so bad
It's best for me, it's best for you
I need you to know that
Tried to love you, but I forced that
All signs, we ignored that
And it's not the same
'Cause it's over now, oh yeah
Don't get too confused, girl, it's over now, oh yeah, uh
No comin' back around, baby
Nothin' left to lose, girl, it's over now
So, I take this just to forget you
I don't regret those memories
And I swear I'm not tryna test
I wish you the best with the life you lead
But you always need that attention
Feedin' the press, when we don't speak
But we're both with somebody else
So please stop callin' me

Won't you please
Slow it down?
I'm tryna talk to you, darlin'
Tryna walk with you, darlin'
Do you hear me?
And no-no-no-no-nobody can stop it
The love you got from me
And every time, I look out at my seat today
They chase, they flash they flash, yes
Tell me how you feel right now
'Cause all I wanna do is keep it real right now
I'm tryna beat it up, Beat Pills right now
Athletic in the sheets, I got skills right
now
Break bread with some red baby hair
Ballin' in the club, Ace of Spades, yeah
Pop that bitch and spray it like 'Raid'
Yellow diamonds on you like a glass of lemonade
QB, I'll throw it
Teeth white, Newports
I want knees like shorts
80 thousand dollar Birkin bag in the Porsche
I'm tryna fuck with you 'til we on life support
I'll split it with you if we get half of Michael Jordan
No toilet tissue, I shit on niggas 'cause life is short
No passport to go with me, I had to get deported

Why wait to say? At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two-faced, but in my heart, I understand
I made my move, and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way
My way
My way
Why wait to say? At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two-faced, but in my heart, I understand
I made my move, and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed

The song was announced on social media four days before its release:
I understood loneliness before I knew what it was
Saw the pills on the table for your unrequited love
Well, I would be nothing without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant (
Ooh
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (
Ooh
We'll be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
Don't hide your emotions, you can throw down your guard
And feed from the notion we can be who we are
You taught me something, yeah, freedom is ours
It was you who taught me living is
Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness
I am a giant
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant

Oh, woah-woah
I don't like to talk, but I love to sing
And I don't smoke, but I love to drink
I'm paranoid, I don't miss a thing
But I'm still nice, at least that's what I think
Fall in love, like I'm a fiend
But then I pull out and say
"I need freedom, I need freedom"
Woah-woah
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
Oh, baby, I'd rather be hard to love than easy to leave
You should believe me, I'll make you need me (
Listen
I'd rather be hard to love than easy to leave
You should believe me, I'll make you need me (
Yeah
'Course you love me, you don't know me
But I got news for you, I came broken
Ego issues, my head is swollen (
Oh, woah-woah
I got a million chips on my shoulder
But if you stick despite all I showed ya
Maybe you don't need freedom, freedom

Oh-oh, oh, oh, ah
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have travelled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever
Exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay
Strollin' so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be

I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringin' me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singin' on my own
Now I can't find the key without you
And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
I'm sorry if it's all too much
Every day you're here, I'm healin'
And I was runnin' outta luck
I never thought I'd find this feelin'
'Cause I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless

Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration, foundation
A special bond of creation, ha
For all the single moms out there
Goin' through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean da Paul
Anne-Marie, sing, make them hear
Sean Paul
She works the nights by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (
Daily struggle
Sean Paul
She tells him, "Ooh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
Stay up there, stay up there
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gon' be nothin' like my life (
Straight
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"
Stay up there, stay up there

I know you're out in Cabo
Hanging with your brother
Wishin' that I was your bottle
So I could be close to your lips again
I know you didn't call your parents
And tell 'em that we ended
'Cause you know that they'd be offended
Did you not want to tell 'em it's the end?
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So, I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Oh, I can't believe it, I
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I'm tryin' not to right now
You weren't a fan of pictures
So I hardly ever took 'em
Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom
So that way I can't forget your skin
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was

It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, e-e-e-everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you (
It solo, solo, everybody
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool (
It solo, solo, everybody
Since you've been gone
I've been dancin' on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause, baby, you're
The only one I'm comin' for
I can't take no more
No more, no more
I wanna f— , but I'm brokenhearted
Cry-cry-cry, but I like to party
Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f— , but I'm brokenhearted
Cry-cry-cry since the day we parted
Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

I tried hard to make you want me
But we're not supposed to be
And the truth will always haunt me
Even though it set me free
And my tears flow like the ocean
As they floated in the breeze
They were falling in slow motion
And they brought me to my knees
You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you
Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

Sé que te gusto a ti todavía
Tres, dos, uno
Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there, and my blood ran cold
Take me back to that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go
I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go
Find me in another place and time
If only, if only you were mine
But I'm already someone else's baby
Luis Fonsi
Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's (
C'mon
Baby, ah
Baby, ah
Baby, ah
I'm already someone else's

She works the nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come, she's got to save him
She tells him, "Oh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye
No, oh-oh
Rockabye

Kamille
I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you (
It solo, solo, everybody
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool (
It solo, solo, everybody
Since you been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby, you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?
I see my body in a different light, ay ay ay
As if I woke up in a different life, ay ay ay
Feels like I'm walking with my heart on fire
Somebody pass me the water 'cause I'm burning
'Cause a little bit's turning into a lot
There's no way I'll be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought I was not
Tell me, tell me, ay ay ay
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?

Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
I don't need no other, I'm satisfied
Doing it on my own
Only takes one lover to change your vibe
Ain't that the way it go?
I don't need nobody, but you're on replay
Caught in the memory
When you touch my body and you say my name
Giving me what I need
Every minute, so lost in it
Like you're in my bed
Every hour, give you power
I'm losing mine instead
24/7, got you on my mind
Think about you all the time
My body wants you night and day
But my head is screaming, "Go away"
24/7, got you on my mind
Darling, I don't have the time
My body wants you night and day
I'm losing all control of me

I've been feeling anxious, ain't been feeling right
I've been staying up, yeah, staying up all night
I've been calling exes, tryna disconnect
I can't cut the wires running 'round my head, head
Need to look after myself
Yeah, I need to take a breath
Need to look after my health
Yeah, I need to disconnect
Yeah, I need to take a breath, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, I need to disconnect, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I go all out all night, yeah, I go home alone
Sleeping in my bed, head beside my phone
Looking at a screen glowing in the dark
I just wanna dream, but I can't seem to switch off
Need to look after myself
Yeah, I need to take a breath
Need to look after my health
Yeah, I need to disconnect

I know what you did last night
I called you up and you declined
I smell perfume, but it ain't mine
It's not okay, but it's alright
'Cause you telling so many lies, I gotta let you go
Now you know what it's like to be all alone
Tell me, how you gonna hurt the one that loves you the most?
'Cause your tears gon' cry a river, go, let it flow
Don't want no cry baby at my door, I'll let him go
Boy, I ain't the same girl I was before
You're only crying 'cause I don't want you back no more
Boy, you had your chance
And you can keep on cryin', baby
I know you been lyin', baby
So you can keep on cryin', baby
I don't know what you're waiting for
I packed your bags outside the door, uh
No, I don't wanna sit and talk
Can you hurry up? I'm bored

“Real Love” follows up Clean Bandit and Jess Glynne’s worldwide hit, “Rather Be”.
This similarly upbeat classical house joint expands on Rather’s theme, celebrating genuine romance.
Oh, you've got the feeling that I wanna feel
Oh, you've got the feeling that I know is real, real, real
It's in the way you look, it's in the way you love
And I can see that this is real, real
It's in the way you talk, it's in the way you touch
And I can see
This is real, real, real, real love
This is real, real, real, real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
Oh, before you I was searching for a rarity
Oh, you showed me things I never thought that I would see
It's in the way you look, it's in the way you love
And I can see that this is real, real
It's in the way you talk, it's in the way you touch
And I can see

People tell me to be cautious
People tell me not to lose my self-control
People tell me to be flawless
People tell me not to let myself evolve
And I think I don't really get it
I think it's all just a peculiar game
And soon I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And everyone will know me by a different name
Alex Newell
I wanted to be stronger (
Stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger, would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?
Gotta be stronger for you, baby
Love you like you want me to
Gotta be stronger for you, baby
Love you like you want me to
I held my breath every time
I tried to keep myself dry
But did I ask too much
If I could do it again
Would you believe what I said?
That I still want that rush

You can see there's something in the way
I've tried to show you, my door is open
I don't know how much more I can take
Since you've chosen to leave me frozen
Am I the only one who sees what you've become?
Will you drift away?
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you stay?
People making choices, they can't fake
Sacrifice it all and maybe say
Something extraordinary, something real
To fill my days and nights with something that I can feel
I'm not gonna compromise, surely you can sympathise?
Say you feel the same?
You've wandered down a path I can't explain
Have you seen her? The grass is greener
To let me pass you by would be a shame
If she's your only, then why are you lonely?
Cause I'm the only one who knows the things you've done
I'm so good for you
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you do?

Bhad Bhabie
Uh, oh damn
Uh, uh, oh damn
It's Clean Bandit
With Charli XCX and Bhad Bhabie, bitch
Had a lover undercover, kept it on the low
Said that you meant nothing but my feelings really grew
Not that I regret you but I met you, went insane
Oh, oh, yeah
Didn't need forever but I needed just a call
Every night at 3 A.M I'm banging on your door
Crying on the marble where we used to fuck 'til dawn
Oh, oh
What're you doing to me?
Used to be a scene from a movie
Now I'm crying tears like a baby
Looking in the mirror, I don't know me
Oh, yeah yeah
Fell in love with a bad, bad dude
Playboy style, should've seen right through
All my friends, they could see the truth
You never loved me, you never loved me, yeah yeah
It's so rare for a girl like me
Playboy style, got me fallin' deep
Did that dirt and I got receipts
You never loved me, you never loved me, yeah yeah

Under my skin, under my skin
Got me strugglin'
Don't know where you end and where I begin
And we feel incredible, we feel no pain
You got me feelin' insane, got me strugglin'
Don't know where you end and where I begin
Had my head underwater
Had my mind under covers
Had my faith in the gutter
Underwater, water, water, water, water, oh
But when you look at me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Nothing matters at all
When I see you with your
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher

I'm out of your control
There's nowhere left to hide
Packed my bags at midnight
And leave this mess behind
Me, myself and I
Have read between the lines
Left the engine runnin'
I guess this is goodbye
And you're never gonna change my mind
We've been here about a thousand times
Should've never let you back inside
Inside my mind
Should've known better than to let you break my heart
I should've known better, I believed you from the start
I should've known better, and now we wasted all this time
I should've known better, so I'm taking back my life
Should've known better than that
Ah, better
Should've known better than that
Ah, better
I should've known better than that

I never said any of this was gonna be simple
But sometimes all it takes is just a symbol, ooh oh
Because the place you want to reach is right in front of you
You're getting stronger
So just keep on that bit longer
Ra pa pum
Girl come over
Mi want you closer
Tired of the rainy days
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine
So before the night's over
I want you to know that
I'm willing to change my ways
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine
Come over, come over
Come over, come, come over
Come over, come over
Come over, come, come over

Continuing the existential themes of A Rush of Blood to the Head, “Clocks” opens with a haunting piano melody into Chris Martin’s falsetto vocals.
The lights go out, and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singin'
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waitin' to be tamed, singin'
You are
You are
Confusion never stops
Closin' walls and tickin' clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singin'
Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
And I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it?
I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I'll wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it?

“Violet Hill” is off of Coldplay’s album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends. It was their first attempt at a protest/political song.
It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops, I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows, they were watchin'
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low
If you love me
Won't you let me know?
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it
"Eating out of the trash"
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, "When you know, you know"
And, "When you don't, you don't"
And all of the foes, and all of the friends
Have seen it before, they'll see it again
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong
But my mama told me, "It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

Her name was Kitty
Made her money being pretty and witty
They gave her the keys to this city
Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
I bought a ticket
She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
Looking back, I guess it was kismet
I waited by the stage door,
packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name,
then glowing like the end of a cigarette, wow, she came out
I said, "You're living my drеam"
Then she said to me
"Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never, ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten, so
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna"

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the mornin', I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

“The Scientist” is a very mellow song about trying to analyze a broken relationship.
The song’s melody is inspired by “Don’t Look Back in Anger” by Oasis, especially the piano part.
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
And tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
No, let's go back to the start
Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessin' at numbers and figures
Pullin' your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
And tell me you love me,
come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Runnin' in circles, chasin' our tails
Comin' back as we are

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
) Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Ooh
) Turn into something beautiful
) And you know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streamin' down your face
When you lose somethin' you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try
to fix you

And said drink from me, drink from me
That we shoot across the sky
Got me feeling drunk and high
Poured on a symphony
So high, so high
That we shoot across the sky
Poured on a symphony
Drink from me, drink from me
That we shoot across the sky
Got me feelin' drunk and high
Poured on a symphony
So high, so high
That we shoot across the sky
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one we know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do
I say, oh
I say, oh
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold onto
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh, yeah, I will, yeah, I will, yes, I will
I said, oh
I cry, oh
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I think I see you, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

"Turn your magic on," Umi, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
We are legends every day"
That's what she told me
"Turn your magic on," to me, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds"
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Said, "I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me"

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

The most personal and emotionally-charged song on Coldplay’s enigmatic A Head Full of Dreams, “Everglow” expresses memory and loss as an ever-lasting “glow.”
Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you celestial
Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars don't slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I can't let you go
But when I'm cold, cold
Yeah, when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feelin' within me, everglow
Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changin' of winds and the way waters flow
Life is short as the fallin' of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know

Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic when I'm with you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still I call it magic when I'm next to you
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still I call it magic, such a precious jewel
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends

Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon
She went
Indigo up in heaven today
Bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
She say
I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again

Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, won't you come and play?
Daddy, do you not care?
Is there nothing that you wanna say?
I know
You're hurting too
But I need you, I do
Daddy, if you're out there
Daddy, all I want to say
You're so far away
Oh, you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
I'm okay
Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, why'd you run away?
Daddy, are you okay?
Look, Dad, we got the same hair
And Daddy, it's my birthday
And all I wanna say

And I (

And you (

In the night, I lie and look up at you
When the morning comes, I watch you rise
There's a paradise they couldn't capture
That bright infinity inside your eyes

Eyes
And they said that we can't be togethеr
Because
becausе we come from different sides

I know that this could hurt me bad
I know that this could feel like that
But I just can't stop
Let my defences drop
I know that I was born to kill
Any angel on my windowsill
But it's so dark inside
I throw the windows wide
I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Still I don't let go
And fields of flowers grow
Oh, it feels like
I'm fallin' in love
Maybe for the first time
Baby, it's my mind you blow
It feels like
I'm fallin' in love
You're throwin' me a lifeline
This is for a lifetime, I know

Hold tight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
"It's alright, it's alright," you said
I got my hands up shaking just to let you know

Oh no, I see
A spiderweb is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said
Oh no, what's this?
A spiderweb, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done
And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm
Oh no, I see
A spiderweb, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble
Singin' that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

What in the world are we going to do?
Look at what everybody's going through
What kind of world do you want it to be?
Am I the future or the history?
'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
Everyone falls, everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
How in the world am I going to see
You as my brother, not my enemy?
'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone sees the colour in each other's eyes
Everyone loves, everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
Hold tight for everyday life
Hold tight for everyday life
At first light, throw my arms out, open wide
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
"You remind me of a younger me," I saw potential
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, "They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign"
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

You thought that it would be okay, at first
The situation could be saved, of course
But they'd already picked out your grave and hearse
Beware the wrath of masked crusaders
Did you girlboss too close to the sun?
Did they catch you having far too much fun?
Come with me, when they see us, they'll run
Something wicked this way comes
Good thing I like my friends cancelled
I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour,
and poison thorny flowers
Welcome to my underworld where it gets quite dark
At least you know exactly who your friends are
They're the ones with matching scars
It's easy to love you when you're popular
The optics click, everyone prospers
But one single drop, you're off the roster
"Tone-deaf and hot, let's fucking off her"

You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
Shoot me down, but I get up
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud, not saying much
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

“2U” is a romantic ode to a woman who is worth the chase and time she demands.
No limit in the sky that I won't fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes that I won't cry for ya, ooh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart when it comes to you
Comes to you
Want you to share that
When it comes to you
Cupid ain't a lie, arrow got your name on it, ooh, yeah
Don't miss out on a love and regret yourself on it, ooh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, ooh

Be my woman, girl, I'll
be your man
Be my woman, girl, I'll
be your man
Yes, I'll be your woman, yes, I'll be your baby
Yes, I'll be whatever that you tell me when you're ready
Yes, I'll be your girl, forever your lady
You ain't ever gotta worry, I'm down for you, baby
Best believe that when you need that
I'll provide that, you will always have it
I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that, I'ma let you have it
Beatin' my drum like, "Dum, di-di, day"
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like, "Hey, mama-ma-ma," "Hey, mama-ma" (
Hey
Bangin' the drum like, "Dum, di-di, day" (
Hey
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like, "Hey, mama-ma-ma," "Hey, mama-ma" (
Hey

You've been dressin' up the truth
I've been dressin' up for you
Then, you leave me in this room, this room
Pour a glass and bite my tongue
You say I'm the only one
If it's true then, why you runnin', you runnin'?
Ooh, woah
If you're really being honest
If you really want this, ooh, woah
Why you acting like a stranger?
What's with your behavior? Ooh, woah
Say my name, say my name
If you love me, let me hear you
Say my name, say my name
I am dyin' to believe you
I feel alone in your arms
I feel you breaking my heart
Say my name, say my name
If you love me, let me hear you
Let me hear you

I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride

Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
You know I'm down for whatever tonight
I don't need the finer things in life
No matter where I go, it's a good time, yeah
And I, I don't need to sit in VIP
Middle of the floor, that's where I'll be
Don't got a lot, but that's enough for me, yeah
'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
One foot in front of the other, babe
One breath leads to another, yeah
Just keep moving, oh, oh
Look within for the strength today
Listen out for the voice to say
Just keep moving, oh, oh
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, you can do this
So, my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today, yeah, yeah
There, my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay, oh
Oh, my love, don't stop burning
Gonna send them up in flames
In flames

I don't wanna lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left
I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read and repeat every conversation
Being with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me a—
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha

You got to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

After collaborating together on “Where Them Girls At,” “Turn Me On” and “Hey Mama;” “Light My Body Up” marks the fourth time David Guetta and Nicki Minaj have worked together on a song.
Mm, yo
I just started my sentence like a capital letter
Got bars for years, I hope you send me a letter
Know she'll never be queen, so now she got a vendetta
I ain't talkin' 'bout David when I say I'ma get her
Twenty mil' on my off season of course
Twenty million when you ain't put out no album or tours
Yes, bitch, I'm me, pretty and icy
Get it? Icy, but my name's spelled N-I-C, uh
I feel like we goin' under
Take me down, I can't help but wonder
You got everything I want and
If you keep on talkin', I'ma put it where you want it
Keep up, ain't no need to slow it down
We could get it poppin', you could love me, love me downtown
You got everything I want now
Let me fill your fantasies and give you what you dream 'bout
You got somethin' that I believe
I've been waitin' for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me
Light my body up

Four of hip-hop’s heavyweights take turns going in over a hard beat by Boi-1da.
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' 'ery girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

You know, a lot of girls be
This is not to get confused
This one's for you
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had , best I ever had
Best I ever had , best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there
Yup
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me

Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First-last, phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo

Alright!
It's a short life, yeah

D. Hill
D. Hill
Ayy
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

Yeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
"Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"
June, you're a genius
I said, "I respect it, no problem"
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man
, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends
snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you
mad
at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn, coach, put him in"
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah

Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife

Black leather glove, no sequins
Buckles on the jacket, it's Alyx shit
Nike crossbody, got a piece in it

Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star-struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no, we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again
Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one

And they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 a.m. to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes, I won't, yeah

Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
TrapMoneyBenny, ayy
I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many

Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling

I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need, my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

You left your mark on me

15 Fort York shit, y'know?
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes

Sandra Graham
Nigga, I said it, I know that you mad
I've emptied the clip over friendlier jabs
You mentioned my seed, now deal with his dad
I gotta go bad, I gotta go bad
Mm, mm, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop a fifty bag for the mob in the spot
Drop a fifty bag, 29 for the thot
Uh, I was really, really tryna keep it PG
I was really, really tryna keep it PG
If you had a set, they'd give your ass a DP
But you civilian gang, in real life, you PC
You know who really bang a set? My nigga YG
You know who really bang a set? My nigga Chuck T
You know who even bang a set out there is CB
And, nigga, Cole losin' sleep on this, it ain't me
You better have some paperwork or that shit fake tea
Can't bе rappin' 'bout no rattin' that we can't read
I mean it's truе a nigga slimed me for my AP
Just like how Metro nigga slimed him for his main squeeze
Out here beggin' for attention, nigga, say please
Always rappin' like you 'bout to get the slaves freed
You just actin' like an activist, it's make-believe
Don't even go back to your hood and plant no money trees
Say you hate the girls I fuck, but what you really mean?
I been with Black and white and everything that's in between
You the Black messiah wifin' up a mixed queen
And hit vanilla cream to help out with your self-esteem
On some Bobby shit, I wanna know what Whitney need
All that puppy love was over in y'all late teens
Why you never hold your son and tell him, "Say cheese"?
We could've left the kids out of this, don't blame me
You a dog and you know it, you just play sweet
Your baby mama captions always screamin', "Save me"
You did her dirty all your life, you tryna make peace
I heard that one of 'em little kids might be Dave Free
Don't make it Dave Free's
'Cause if your GM is your BM secret BD
Then this is all makin' plenty fuckin' sense to me
Ayy, let that shorty breathe
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake, now shake that ass for free
Yeah, yeah
Well, not that kind of free, I'm talkin' 'bout my nigga Dave
Your man a lil' K, we call that shit a mini Drac'
He always said I overlooked him, I was starin' straight
These bars go over Kenny head no matter what I say
I know you like to keep it short, so let me paraphrase
Knew it was smoke when Abel hit us with the serenade
Nigga said, "Uh, uh"
Almost started reachin' for my waist

I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (
Yeah
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (
2 Chainz
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring,
doggin' these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert, ill nigga alert"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If havin' a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested

“From Time” is penned as a conversation between Drake and an old flame.
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
"Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?"
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it

No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Fuck bein' on some chill shit

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it;

Yeah, that mean I'm way up
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season

Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker, that's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we could really get it, we could go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't made me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

Yeah, yeah
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really, you never were solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
You're not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone
Oh, but when you're gone, when you're gone, when you're gone
Oh, baby, all the lights go out
Thinking now that maybe I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
Oh, baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you, do for you, do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock
He can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You'd probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving till late in the night
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, oh, same me
Inside
If you don't like the way I talk
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock
Then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue
You'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

One
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Something in you-ou-ou
Lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

If you don't wanna see me
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

J Balvin
Bad Bunny
You know that sometimes I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Eh-eh
Pero contigo es todo o na'
-eh
Yeah-yeah
You're deep in the water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now, but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

If you wanna
run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we
fell into
a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (
You're the
moonlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

Billboard Baby, Dua Lipa make 'em dance when it come on
Everybody lookin' for a dancefloor to run on
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yеah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, comе on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (
You're the moonlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv makin' dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbin' if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothin' but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal 'cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's gettin' dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities stickin' their noses in
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

It's late in the evenin', glass on the side
I've been sat with you for most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Louder
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Na-na-na-na
Mmm
I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Ooh, ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

Build the fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas
We'll
dance in the kitchen
while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bеautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas
The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

I met her smokin' a cigarette in a toilet cubicle
Red  dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful
This  ain't the time or place to start a future, but, darlin', I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere
Well, darlin', here we go again
We  are only man and woman and we all make mistakes
"Don't  you know we're only human?", is what I heard you say
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain
'Cause  I have felt the same, no
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh,  can you see the love in mine?
She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls
Well, darlin', here we go again
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are
And I could put you back together when you come apart
And we should make a start now, oh

It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth
Why am I feelin' so nervous when
Things are goin' so perfect? And
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you

I will remember you
In the way you'd want me to
But it's hard to come to terms right now
Sunset looked today
As if it knew you'd gone away
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down
Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain
Oh, I could be a shoulder, not a burden
And it's time for me to call your son again
And say
She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away
I will remember you
With white wine by the barbecue
On New York at the birthday do, downtown
All that comes to mind
Is a memory of laughin' out loud

Welcome to the world
I heard your heart beat and lost every word
Just stood there quietly taking in the sound
Of our love
This is gonna hurt
But I'll stand beside you, for better or for worse
And I will find you whenever you're lost
I'll be right here
And ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away
Welcome to the world
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt
Don't let them change you, words are only words
Just like I loved you
And yes, you were the first
A new beginning, bright and unreserved
A beautiful red flower in the earth
Will grow, and I know

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't brеak my boat
The stones crash on the boardwalk
Thе wind rush through the trees
I keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been
Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight"
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

“Supermarket Flowers” is Ed’s tribute to his late grandmother. Using the metaphor of an angelic persona, the lyrics focus on the positive aspects and impact left behind by one who is now deceased.
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get-well-soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But, Mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it, too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you?

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

“Galway Girl” is a blend of Irish folk tradition and Ed’s signature acoustic pop style. The lyrics depict a man and woman meeting in an Irish pub and dancing and singing the night away.
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?"
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Oh, baby, I apologise for it
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history?
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mm

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a handprint on the door
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before
This is our luck, baby, running out
Our clothes were never off
We still have our roads to run about
To scale the map, to scale the map to get us back on track
I've seen you in a fight you lost
I've seen you in a fight
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys

Oh, oh, starry-eyed
Hip, oh, sta-a-a-a—
Oh, oh, deye-yrrats
​swolg ydobyrevE, starry-eyed
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning
Handlebars that I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in and I'll throw out my heart and get a new one
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning, ah
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah
Woah, oh, oh
So we burst into colours, colours and carousels
Fall head first like paper planes and playground games

I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
Noises
I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathin'
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world
If I was a sculptor, but, then again, no
Or a girl who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

Stripped to the waist, we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over
Yes, since we found out, since we found out
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could
After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its colour
But now I've seen it through and now I know the truth
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could

We don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race
When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shinin' up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We were lovers for the first time
Running all the red lights
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah
We were sipping on emotions
Smoking and inhaling every moment
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah
We were high and we were sober
We were on and we were over
We were young and now I'm older
But I'd do it all again
Getting drunk on a train track
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes
Ten dollars was a fat stack
I'd do it all again
Bomber jacket and a snapback
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach
"Re: Stacks" on the playback
I'd do it all again
We were lovers on a wild ride
Speeding for the finish line
Come until the end of our time, yeah
Started off as a wildfire
Burning down the bridges to our empire
Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah

You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin
Is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both hate everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle
Swae Lee
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (
Yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me (
Woo
You can never come too close for comfort
I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn
I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover
And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber
Iced out body, didn't go to college
Price tag poppin', then you on a private
Don't say sorry, everyone's watchin'
When you're where I am, everything's timeless

Remember me in a simple way, not what I did or said
When I think of you now, I just think of the day we met
Don't forget me, like I didn't care
Yeah, I stole from myself just to make you complete
I don't think you have the patience
I don't think you know the difference
And I don't want cute imitations
I know you wanted to save me
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on
Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know, I wanna know
When the memories pack up and leave, it will set me free
All those days on the beach will be washing away from me
I will keep you secretly just to keep the peace
Keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas

Do you remember when we moved out?
My mum said, "I love you, but it's a small house"
So we changed up and saved up
Gave up our town
We were dangerous, couldn't tame us
What's missing now?
Time (
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Suddenly, we got no time (
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
We're so busy doing life (
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine
If you just focus on me
Like we were sixteen
And plotting our lives
Can I wear your t-shirt and sleep
On you while I dream
Of all the good times?
When we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen

You can worry 'bout this
You can worry 'bout that
You can worry 'bout she
You can worry 'bout this
You can worry 'bout that
You can worry 'bout she
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me
Lately, I don't think, I don't think about you, feelin' so free
Been jumpin' through hoops to get under you, but now I'm cool
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me
Been havin' good times
Been havin' late nights, yeah
And then you call me
Ask if I'm alright, what the hell?
Sayin' that you care about me
But you just wanna be in my head 'cause you're lonely
I thought I needed you to feel safe
But now that I've been through it, I'm stuck in a good place
Ooh, why you tryna put me in a different mood?
Just because I'm still not seein' someone new?

Painted to pure perfection
We had a real connection
Bodies aching, overtaken
You kept me at a distance
Not asking any questions
Fingers pressing, learning lessons
Beautiful lies on a Friday night
Starting to wonder where we lost the magic
Head in the clouds, talking so loud, all I hear is static
I'm not a material girl
Everything in your world just feels like plastic
Wearing your crown, it's pulling me down
You just want the power
You're not really down for love
You just want the power
No, I'm not chasing paper
And I'm not faking neither
Take me higher or this will expire
Your self obsessions boring
Sorry if I'm ignoring
Mindless actions lead to destruction

Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed
I bet you're still walkin' on a tightrope
Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho
You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know
It's a thin line between all this love and hate
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place
So, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
Yeah, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

Fire and ice
This love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I can
How long will I need you?
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan
How long will I be with you?
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand
How long will I want you?
As long as you want me to
And longer by far
How long will I hold you?
As long as your father told you
As long as you can

That feeling that doesn't go away just did
And I walked a thousand miles to prove it
And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
The colour of my blood is all I see on the rocks as you sail from me
Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me
My bones will bleach, my flesh will flee
So help my lifeless frame to breathe
And God knows I'm not dying, but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew
The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
And my blood is all I see as you steal my soul from me
Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me

“Army” is about her best friend. She described the song on Instagram:
I know that I've been messed up
You never let me give up
All the nights and the fights
And the blood and the breakups
You're always there to call up
I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid
But yeah, you understand
Yeah like no one can
I know that we don't look like much
But no one fucks it up like us
16 and you never even judged me
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me
Sitting there in the caravan
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

I used to be a rollin' stone, ya know
If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beatin' for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say, the more my work gets done
'Cause I live and breathe this
Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man, yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had
Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, an' I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom,
I love ya
Yes, I do
If you choose to, you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city
Some others choose the good old family home
I like livin' easy without family ties
'Til the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no
sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

It's a little bit funny
This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travellin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

Russel Mulcahy, video director of the videoclip, told us ‘I Want My MTV!’:
You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well, look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin', you just fade away
Don't you know, I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standin'
I'm still standin'
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hittin' somethin' that's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
solid walls of sound
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums
But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life  to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life  to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour, 9 a.m.​​
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
burnin' out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
burnin' out his fuse up here alone
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all the science, I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man

There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singin' the blues
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm goin' back to my plough
Back to the howlin' old owl in the woods
Huntin' the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

Likely inspired by the song Daddy Cool’s “Eagle Rock” and Neil Sedaka’s “Oh! Carol,” “Crocodile Rock” comments on rock’s evolution over time using metaphors.
I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you (
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (
No, no, no, no, no
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man
Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
I'm walkin' down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone

Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mindfuck America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Well, maybe I'm the faggot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Say, hey, cha
Hear the sound of the fallin' rain
Comin' down like an Armageddon flame
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery"
And bleed, the company lost the war today
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
Hear the drum poundin' out of time
Another protester has crossed the line
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen?
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Fuck
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothin' and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?
I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whinin' 'cause it's bringin' her down
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh-yuh-yuh-yuh

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Do you know what's worth fightin' for
When it's not worth dyin' for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocatin'?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of Suburbia
The bible of "none of the above"
On a steady diet of
Soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my
Sins in Hell as far as I can tell
'Least the ones I got away with
And there's nothin' wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me
Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
A living room on my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
Doin' someone else's cocaine

I'm havin' trouble tryin' to sleep
I'm countin' sheep, but runnin' out
As time ticks by, still I try
No rest for cross-tops in my mind
On my own, here we go
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulgin' out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own, here we go
My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughin' in my face
A crooked spine,
my senses dulled
Past the point of delirium
On my own, here we go
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulgin' out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own, here we go

Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you been thinking about ditching me
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
Hoo

Mike Dirnt
) A small cloud has fallen, the white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
Vegging on one detail, the rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red
Picture sounds
Of moving insects, so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
Mike Dirnt
) Laying in my bed, I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
) You're standing so damn close, my body begins to swell
Why does 1 and 1 make 2?

Why does 1 and 1 make 2?

I sit around and watch the
tube
, but nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors, and I'm fuckin' lazy
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blind
And I smell like shit
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me movin'
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feelin' like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell and I lost the key
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blind
And I smell like shit

My heart is beatin' from me
I am standin' all alone
Please call me only if you are comin' home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust
What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure? What is your pain?
Do you dream too much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch?

The blue stash of men, they claimed responsibility for the executions
Described as severely mentally disturbed
It appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group
Deserve to be annihilated
I get my kicks, and I wanna start a rager
I wanna dance like I'm on the video
I got a fever for the violent behavior
I'm sweatin' bullets like a modern Romeo
Bang! Bang! Gimme fame!
Shoot me up to entertain (
Ah-ah
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed!
Give me death or gimme head (
Ah-ah
Daddy's little psycho, and Mommy's little soldier
I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live, and it's on my radio
I got my photobomb, I got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else

She, she screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with a brick of self-control
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm takin' heed just for you
She, she's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Wakin' up this time
To smash the silence with a brick of self-control
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm takin' heed just for you
Yeah

Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face, but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been
Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry ol' what's-his-face?
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face, but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
The regrets are useless in my mind
She's in my head, I must confess
The regrets are useless in my mind
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go

Dear mother, can you hear me whinin'?
It's been three whole weeks since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me tremblin'
'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feelin' so alone
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I wanna take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason, it's now feelin' like my home
And I'm never gonna go
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I wanna take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

Nobody likes you, everyone left you
They're all out without you, having fun
Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collectin' unemployment checks
A flunky only along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
"What's in love is now in debt"
On your birth certificate
So strike the fuckin' match to light this fuse, 'use
The town bishop's an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Stand still when it's do or die
You better run for your fuckin' life
It's not over 'til you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin', it's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
There is nothin' left to analyze

I text a postcard sent to you, did it go through?
Sendin' all my love to you
You are the moonlight of my life every night
Givin' all my love to you
My beatin' heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sendin' all my love to you
With every breath that I am worth here on Earth
I'm sendin' all my love to you
So if you dare to second-guess, you can rest
Assured that all my love's for you
My beatin' heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sendin' all my love to you

“Give Me Novacaine” is about Jesus of Suburbia wanting to take drugs to relieve stress from his life and asking for reassurance from his alter ego St. Jimmy.
Take away the sensation inside
Bittersweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbin' toothache of the mind
I can't take this feelin' anymore
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feelin' and that's alright
Jimmy says it's better than here
I'll tell you why
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
Oh, Novacaine

Tre Cool
St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette, he's insubordinate
Comin' at you on the count of one, two
One, two, three, four
My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your mama talked about
King of the Forty Thieves
and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment
I'm the
patron saint
of the denial
With an
angel face
and a taste for suicidal
Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city in the halo of lights
Product of war and fear that we've been victimized
I'm the
patron saint
of the denial
With an
angel face
and a taste for suicidal

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Oh my God
Ooh-ooh
Cha
Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Ah, ah
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Oh, I, I wanna watch you bleed
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed, but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, who's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Ah, ah
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Oh, I, I wanna hear you scream

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah
Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

“Don’t Cry” is a Guns N' Roses melodic ballad off their 1991 album Use Your Illusion I.
Talk to me softly, there's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
I know how you feel inside, I've, I've been there before
Something is changing inside you and don't you know?
Don't you cry tonight
I still love you, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now and please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you and the times we had, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

Ooh, ooh
Hey
Mama, take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey-hey, yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh-oh, yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, aye-hey, yeah
Ooh-oh, yeah, oh, yeah, aw
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey-hey, yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh, yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, aye-aye, yeah
Ooh

Strother Martin
What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God
and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

One, two
One, two, three, four
Guess I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind, some peace of mind that'll stay
So I thumbed it down to 6th in L.A.
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way
Police and niggas, that's right, get out of my way
Don't need to buy none of your gold chains today
Now, don't need no bracelets clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket, 'til then, won't you cut me some slack?
You're one in a million, yeah, that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you, but you were much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high, ow
Immigrants and faggots, they make no sense to me
They come to our country and think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini-Iran or spread some fucking disease
They talk so many goddamn ways, it's all Greek to me
Well, some say I'm lazy, ooh, and others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy, I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to an end, I-I keep it moving along
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

One, two
One, two, three, four
*Whistling*
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now
Said, woman, take it slow, it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
Patience
Mm, yeah
I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Just a urchin livin' under the street, I'm a
Hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line
Rags to riches, or so they say, you gotta
Keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know, it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doin' the time
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah, yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

If I say I don't need anyone, I can say these things to you, 'cause
I can turn on anyone just like I turned on you
I've got a
Tongue like a razor, a sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors, but then you'll do whatever I like
Here I am, and you're a rocket queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a rocket queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene
I've seen everything imaginable pass before these eyes
I've had everything that's tangible, honey, you'd be surprised
I'm a bisexual innuendo in this burned-out paradise
If you turn me on to anything, you better turn me on tonight
Here I am, and you're a rocket queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a rocket queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene
Cha

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

You thought that it would be okay, at first
The situation could be saved, of course
But they'd already picked out your grave and hearse
Beware the wrath of masked crusaders
Did you girlboss too close to the sun?
Did they catch you having far too much fun?
Come with me, when they see us, they'll run
Something wicked this way comes
Good thing I like my friends cancelled
I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour,
and poison thorny flowers
Welcome to my underworld where it gets quite dark
At least you know exactly who your friends are
They're the ones with matching scars
It's easy to love you when you're popular
The optics click, everyone prospers
But one single drop, you're off the roster
"Tone-deaf and hot, let's fucking off her"

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
"You remind me of a younger me," I saw potential
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, "They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign"
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
If we never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullet?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, a bullet?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay
Wouldn't put it like that
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming around
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without

Walk in your rainbow paradise
Strawberry lipstick state of mind
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Your wonder under summer skies
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

I had started to feel myself becoming someone I didn’t want to be, and that was really hard.
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you
Ooh, ooh

You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal"
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm
Matilda
, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up
You can see the world, following the seasons
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it
But I'm into it , I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your, it's none of your—"
It's New York, baby, always jacked up
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus
In a black dress,
she's such an actress

Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with it
I'm here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on my fingertips
And up to your mouth, I'm feelin' it out
I'm feelin' it now
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you t—
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that something, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are in
I mess around with him
And I'm okay with it

Coucou
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I confess
I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that
There's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?

Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Browns my skin just right
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I, I can feel it take a hold
I can feel you take control
Of who I am and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
Golden

“Sweet Creature” is about two people facing difficulties in their relationship. They take comfort in knowing they belong together despite all the arguments.
Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going
But we know where we belong
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But, oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
Sweet creature
Running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough

Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you, and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And this was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Tellin' those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimmin' in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart   beat

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Uhh, ahh
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive

First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second things second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age, taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few that look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain, taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold,
have a seat
In the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder
Kids were laughin' in my classes
While I was schemin' for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smilin' from the stage while
You were clappin' in the nosebleeds

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

Look out for yourself
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
My enemy-y-y-y-y
But I'm ready
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Ty Dolla $ign
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Ooh , I'm just a sucker for pain
Dolla $ign
I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog
Love and the loyalty, that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Ooh , I'm just a sucker for pain

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Will the stars align?
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for (
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems

Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
Woah
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, woah
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive

There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it
We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today
It's gotta get easier, oh, easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today, not today
There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road was at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones
Playin' with a stick of dynamitе
There was nevеr gray in black and white
There was never wrong till there was right
Feelin' like a bould
r hurtlin'
Seein' all the vultures circlin'
Burnin' in the flames, I'm workin' in
Turnin
' in a bed, that's darkenin'

Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is ragin' against us now
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire
There's nights we had to just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time
But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

“Warriors” is a song written and recorded by American alt-rockers Imagine Dragons.
As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream
Here we are, don't turn away now (
Don't turn away
We are the warriors that built this town (
This town
Here we are, don't turn away now (
Don't turn away
We are the warriors that built this town (
This town
From dust
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love
Here we are, don't turn away now (
Don't turn away
We are the warriors that built this town (
This town
Here we are, don't turn away now (
Don't turn away
We are the warriors that built this town (
This town
From dust

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving
I take it in, but don't look down
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I coulda gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Look out for yourself
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
My enemy-y-y-y-y
But I'm ready
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Can't take the way you mistreated me (
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (
Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hmm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together? I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
Wake up and rise and shine
Best get to work on time
No more playing video games
Things are about to change
We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hmm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together? I ain't your mama

If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?
Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, bae
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue, yeah
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

“Waiting For Tonight” was originally sung by girl group 3rd Party in 1997.
Oh, yeah
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

¡Gente de Zona!
Lo mejor que suena ahora
JLo
Como en la vida, el amor es así
Nace de la nada y se convierte en todo
Nunca imaginé enamorarme así
No tenías previsto sentir amor
El amor es así
Inspirador, cautivador
Conmovedor, provocador
Y a veces tentación
El amor es así
Controlador, es dictador
Emocionante, apasionante
Depredador
Gente de Zona
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

Me tratas como una princesa y me das lo que pido
Tú tienes el bate y la fuerza que yo necesito
Cuando estamos solos, te juro, no me falta nada
Te pongo un trece de diez cuando estamo' en la cama
Nunca había sentido algo tan grande
Y me vuelve loca tu lado salvaje
Tú me has dado tanto que he estado pensando
Ya lo tengo todo, pero
Oscarcito
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (
Yeah, yeah
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (
Te tiene loca
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (
Yeah, yeah
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (
Te tiene loca
Hueles como me gusta, me besas como me gusta
Me agarras como me gusta, así, así, que a mí me gusta
Como muerde la fruta , si sale de noche, me asusta
Sin mapa conoces la ruta, así, así, que me gusta
Sigue aquí, papi, estoy pa' ti
Dale atrás, que así somos las del Bronx
Don't stop, muévete más, que siga la fiesta conmigo no más
No pierdas el enfoque, papi, tienes la clase cuando apenas la toque
Home run con tres en base

Murder Inc., haha
It must be the ass that got me like damn
If it get any fatter, man, the Rule gon' have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the L-O, hello
, no, I'm not
Lee Harvey Oswald
, I'm the Rule and a shot call
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now
Ain't that funny?
Ashanti
It's been a while since you came around
Now you wanna see what's goin' down
Tryna tell me how you want my time
Tryna tell me how I'm on your mind (
On your mind
See, it never had to be this way
You should've never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kind of lame
Knowin' how the situation change
Ashanti
Ain't that funny? (
Ain't it funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me, love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (
Ain't it funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me, love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

Estoy loca, enamorada de ti
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Dance, yes (
RedOne
Love, next
Dance, yes (
J.Lo
Love , next
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
I'm a old dirty dog all day
No way, José
Your girl only go one way, ay, mi madre
You should check that out
Maybe you won't turn her out
Maybe it's none of my business
But for now, work it out, let's get this, dale
Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside
I find it so stupid, so why should I hide
That I love to make love to you, baby?
Yeah, make love to me
So many ways, wanna touch you tonight
I'm a big girl, got no secrets this time
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby
Yeah, make love to me

Think you gotta keep me iced? You don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash? I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz? I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw the dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pullin' up your sleeve, so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raisin' up a toast, so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're ballin' out of control
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

This entire song can be taken two different ways: One, Kanye is talking about his relationship with fame . Two, he’s talking about a specific girl in his life.
Whose fault?
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure
On the bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fuckin' self
'Til about 2 a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

They used to tell me
Used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million-dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing, remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined it so much, some nights, it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots, but it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights, it felt like draft day, you know
My, my stepbrother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas, look
Think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million-dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like, "Ain't too much that's different"
I be shinin', they be shinin',
get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know 'bout wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

I found myself dreamin'
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walkin' on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone
I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief,
and I've realised
No, we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standin'
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you

It breaks my heart
They ain't believe in us
We the
Best Music
They played themselves
While you hatin' and being jealous
You could be over here embracing that love
More love, more blessings, more life
GOD DID
GOD DID
You either win with us or you watch us win
DJ Khaled
Rick Ross
They wanted us down, ooh-woah
But look at us now, oh
They counted us out (
Time to say a prayer
M-M-M—
They didn't think that we would make it, oh (
May we bow our heads
They didn't believe in us, oh (
Huh
Rick Ross
But I know God did, God did
Oh, God did (Oh-oh,
Khaled
Oh, yes, God did (Oh-oh,
Khaled
Oh, God did (
God is great
But I know God did

I got the world in my hands, the masterplan
But I don't know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don't know why I keep callin',
why I keep callin' you, hey
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now. What, huh?
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now. Huh?
I'm in my
Christian Dior
with a
Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir
Chanel
Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa
Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I'm in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar
was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik
and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I'm very single
Abbey Lee too, I'm a freak, boo
I'm wilding, I'm on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen

Hey
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
with Ariana Grande
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh-woah
Hey
Yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're past the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you've made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
Ohh
Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Everyday women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
True and livin' livin' in us,
resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say, "Stay down", and we stand up
Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up
King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up

Birds don't, birds don't, birds don't, birds don't
Lost in emotion, mama's youngest
Tryna navigate life without my compass
Some experience death and feel numbness
But not me, I felt it all and couldn't function
Seein' you that day
Tellin' you my plans but I was leavin' you that day
It was in God's hands,
Ye was at Elon's waiting to get with me
On my way to Texas, that's when Virginia hit me
And I realized in that instant
Our last conversation, you was against it
Told you I was going to Turks for Thanksgiving
I heard what I wanted to hear but didn't listen
You said you told Gene that Bup needed forgiveness
I see you went to DD's and stuffed both her fridges
You even told Dad you wished y'all never splitted
See, you were checkin' boxes, I was checkin' my mentions
Sayin' you was tired but not ready to go
Basically was dying without letting me know
I loved you met Nige, hate that he won't remember you
Two things that break my heart is what Novembers do
And T follows you, now mind you
DD calls you, Gene finds you, was that your vision?
Precision, while I'm reminiscin'
It all hits different, Ma, listen

Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Last night was the worst night
Beginning of the end
Or maybe it began before and here we go again
Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine
I don't understand, oh
There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong, oh, you always seem to blame me
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Workin' your back like, it's going out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now, girl
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
Got an obsession, of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission, so
Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
We could go all night
Give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

{*23 seconds of instrumental to open*}
They wait to plead their case, unknown cast aside
I love to see their face, can we spare the lie?
Are we afraid to see them, prisoners of history
These beautiful minds, trapped inside, bring them back to life
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Ooooooohhhhhhhhhh
Aowwwww
So dark when I see sparks, if we don't snuff 'em out
We've gotta let 'em flame, let 'em speak their name
Let 'em reach up to the clouds
Can't eat if we don't feed 'em, can't read if we don't teach 'em
There's no light if we just hide 'em
Don't just let 'em die
Let 'em shine  let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine  let 'em shine on
Oh let 'em shine on  let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine on  let 'em shine, on
Ohhhhh sparks flicker, in the distance
Lonely out in space
They sing out, but we're not listening
Cause we don't see their face
We can't let 'em die we can't, make 'em hide
All the little miracles that live inside
Let 'em shine, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh

There ain't no time
No time for sorrow
And we ain't got time no time
Ah time to be sad
And maybe the world ain't what it could be
But to understand why is to know reality
Ah don't give in
Ah I said hang on
How many times did you hear your mom and daddy?
Say oh child I never had it so good
I wanna say thank you, thank you for the start
Cause deep in my soul, I know you did all that you could
I'm just a part of your dreams this I know
But I'll do what ever possible to make this thing grow
Ah don't give in
I said hang on
Ah now say tomorrow you woke up a king
Now tell me just how would you fix everything?
You walk around complaining about how things are
But what have you added to this world so far
Check out your mind, and see what the answer is
And tell me how much did you give
Ah don't give in
I said hang on

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Me plus you
Me plus you (
One time; I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you (
One time; I'ma tell you one time
One time
One time
When I met you, girl, my heart went knock, knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop, stop
And even though it's a struggle, love is all we got
So we gon' keep, keep climbing to the mountain top
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right
And girl, you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (
Girl, I love, girl, I love you

), and I was like (
Uh-huh

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I could take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby, take a chance, or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I don't know about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go
Tell me what you like, yeah, tell me what you don't
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I'ma make you shine bright, like you’re laying in the snow, burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind
Swaggy

As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now , you know, girl
We both know, it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, love me
As long as you love me, love me
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress , and don't cry
Oh, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take , my hand

Yeah
Young Money
Justin, rrr
Show you off
Tonight, I wanna show you off
What you got
A billion could've never bought
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya
'Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all  'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
'Cause all—

What do you mean?  Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna  say no
What do you mean?  Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do  you mean? Oh,  what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time,  what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm sayin'
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complainin'
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night
First you're up, then you’re down, and then  between
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean? Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Hoppin' on the red-eye
Hoppin' on the red-eye
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent in your route
See you when I touch down
You're my champagne
You make me pop off everywhere like confetti
I know it seems strange
I seen you last night and I miss you already
My bed is depressed
My pillow's a victim
Got me in chills while my hands are sweaty (
B-O-I
And I gotta fly out (
Hate you got me strung-out (
And I gotta fly out (
Hey
Hate you got me strung-out, oh-ooh
Only been ten hours but my sanity is gone
Hoppin' on the red-eye (
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag,
, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (
Hey
, big bag, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag,

Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this
You encourage everyone without tryin'
All of your boundaries keep me in line
God is within us, what you're always sayin'
Your energy is enough to suffice
Your intentions are obvious
Your affection's miraculous
Every promise you make, you keep
Never met nobody else like this, only angels speak like this
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, la-di-da, la-di-da
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, di-da, la-da
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, di-da, da-da
Only angels speak like this

Had a dream, I was high
Holdin' on to the sky
But I heard your voice and stopped myself from fallin'
There'll be days, there'll be nights
When the stars don't align
And the sun can't even stop the rain from pourin'
So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go
'Cause all I know
This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what , no mattеr what
It's only us
Yeah, no matter what
Got you good, in the bag
Evеrything that I have
When the silence fills the air, just know I'm on it
When the waves start to crash
Like a fear from the past
Just remember that you're all I've ever wanted (
Ever wanted

Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
In the mornin' or the late
Say the word, on my way
Bona fide stallion
Ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run
Ain't on the side, you're number one
Yeah, every time I come around, you get it done
Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hundred racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah

I got my peaches out in Georgia
I get my weed from California
I took my chick up to the North, yeah
I get my light right from the source, yeah
And I say, oh
The way I breathe you in
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There's nothing like your touch
It’s the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia
I get my weed from California
I took my chick up to the North, yeah
I get my light right from the source, yeah
You ain't sure yet
But I'm for ya
All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I’m in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

Throwin' petals like, "Do you love me or not?"
Head is spinnin', and it don't know when to stop
'Cause you said, "Forever," babe, did you mean it or not?
Hold on, hold on
You leave me on read, babe, but I still get the message
Instead of a line, it's three dots, but I can connect them
And if it ain't right, babe, you know I'll respect it
But if you need time, just take your time
Honey, I get it, I get it, I get it
Way you got me all in my head
Think I'd rather you in my bed
Whatever it is, you know I can take it
I'm countin' the days, how many days 'til I can see you again?
Blowin' kisses like, "Will you catch 'em or not?"
I'm Cupid with arrows, babe, I'm just shootin' my shot, mm-mm
If I could get in, drop me a pin, hop in the— and come over
Don't wanna be friends, just skin-to-skin, I wanna get closer and closer and closer, uh
The way you got me all in my head
Think I'd rather you in my bed
Whatever it is, you know I can take it
I'm countin' the days, how many days 'til I can see you again?

Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror's staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh, I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

Timbaland
Ooh-oh

Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby, 'cause
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit (
Check it
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Wait a minute
You ready, JT?
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Hey, going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow! Burned myself, I just had to touch it
But it's so fire, and it's all mine
Hey, baby, and we don't mind all the watchin', ha
'Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn somethin'
She ain't nothin' but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight
And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swingin' in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh
Everyone knows
all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there
Everybody says, "Say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin'"
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Chris Stapleton
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have

Get your sexy on

I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
, got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine
Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon
So keep dancin'

You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance and made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say
What you did
I already know
I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy
The bridges were burned
, now it's your turn to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day
Dance with me
Guy time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you, girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on, let's give it a whirl
See, I've been watchin' you
And I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass-shakin' thing you do
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right

Hey little mama
Ain't gotta ask me if I want to
Tell me, can I get a light?
Roll you up and let it run through my veins
'Cause I can always see the farthest stars when I'm on you
I don't wanna ever come down from this cloud of loving you
'Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
You're my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Roll me up
'Cause all I want is you, baby
One more time
Pusher girl
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
Be my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Hook me up
All I want is you, baby
You're my little pusher love girl, ain't ya?
Just my little pusher love girl

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS
Like a bitch, I would know
And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You don't really wanna stay, no
But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
’Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
I know it, I know it
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Ayy, yeah
Katy Perry, Migos, ayy
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby
Looks like you been starvin'
You got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cookin', boy
Let me take you
Under candlelight
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winnin'
lay 'em up like

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
Snoop Dogg
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees (
Yeah, yeah
, undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek
What? What? What?
At us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Snoop Dogg
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent
now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (
Ayy

Yeah, y'all know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy , your enemy
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no goin' back

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard with an open heart
How did I read the stars so wrong?
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see ain't always what it seems
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete
Fallin' from cloud nine
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night,
yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

I'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you
Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

I got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
I'm tryna bathe my ape  in your Milky Way
I'm a legend, I'm irreverent, I be reverend
I be so far up-up-up-up-up, we don't give a fu-u-u**
Welcome to the danger zone, step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me a alien, a big-headed astronaut
Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
They say, "Be afraid"
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?
I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
We're far from the shallow now

I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em,
let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

Gaga talked to Grazia about writing this record saying:
Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it's free
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love, ayy
I want your drama, the touch of your hand (
Hey
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, your bad romance

Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Pay the toll to the angels
Drawing circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life
Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance,
now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night
"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na"
In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight"

It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital "H-I-M"
M, M, M, M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

An excerpt from a separate interview:
We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastico
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those
flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt
, yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry
, it don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I

R. Kelly
Yeah
Turn the mic up
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothin' at all
It's comin' down on me
Water like misery
It's comin' down on me

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain on me
Mm, oh yeah, baby
Rain on me
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try, mm
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah

Sou-sour candy
I'm sour candy
So sweet, then I get a little angry
, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho
Make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jisoo
Jennie
Ask me to be nice, and then I'll do it extra mean
뜻밖의 표정 하나에 넌 당황하겠지
비싼 척이란 말들로 날 포장한 건 너야, 너야
If you wanna fix me, then let's break up here and now
거리낌 없는 눈빛에 넌 거릴 두니까
툭 까보면 어김없이 소리질러와
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you see inside, inside, inside

“Sexxx Dreams” was first debuted at Lady Gaga’s iTunes Festival set in September of 2013.
Last night
) Our lovers' quarrel
I was thinkin' about you
) Hurts more than I can say
And it was kind of dirty
) All night
And the way that you looked at me
Help me here (
It was kind of nasty, aah!
Help me here (
It was kind of trashy
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
We could be caught (
I just want this to be perfect
We're both convicted criminals of thought
'Cause I'm broken
Let's white
By the one before
Glove the bed
He was kind of nasty
Help me here (
And I feel so trashy
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads

Truth!
RedOne
Konvict
Gaga (
Oh-oh, eh
I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush
A dizzy twister dance
, can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone
What's goin' on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore (
Woo
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, a-alright
Just dance
Gonna be okay, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Spin that record, babe, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just, j-j-just dance

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

Money
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands
Hands above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary
Love

WARNING: SPOILERS FOLLOW
Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on

Turnin' up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting to manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save 'em 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Front I've built around my oasis
Paradise is in my hands
Holdin' on so tight to this status
It's not real, but I'll try to grab it
Keep myself in beautiful places
Paradise is in my hands

I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause
Give me that thing that I love
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
Give me that thing that I love
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant,
and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days
, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh

Down on the West coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah, you
You're falling hard, I push away
, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say, "I miss you so much"
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock 'n' roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, my love

I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?
I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter
Call him up, "Come into my bedroom"
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymorе
This is the experiеnce of bein' an American whore
Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files
wasn't on
Watching
Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this

Swingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Whistlin' my name
Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here
And play a video game"
I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say, "You the bestest," lean in for a big kiss, put his favorite perfume on
"Go play your video game"
It's you, it's you, it's all for you, everything I do
I tell you all the time, Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And, baby, now you do
Mmm
Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Livin' for the fame
Kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's, this is my idea of fun
Playin' video games

One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around
Lana Del Rey
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said "I love you"
You're fun and you’re wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?

Mountain
Why? (
Got that?
Who? Me? (
Louder
Why? (
Got that?
Mountain
Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (
Louder
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Mountain
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (
Louder, alright
Choose your last words
, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

You're
good for me
Baby, you're no
good
for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want you
Diet Mountain Dew, baby,
New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Baby, put on heart-shaped
sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I been waitin' up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright
Hit me, my darling, tonight
I don't know why but I like it
Gotta get back to the wild
Give it up, give it up
Live it up, live it up

“Love” sees Lana treading her familiar themes of nostalgia for an idealized American past.
Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in lo-ove
To be young and in lo-ove
Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it
Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

Lyrics not found

I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratchin' counter tops, I was screamin'
My back arched like a cat
My position couldn't stop, you were hittin'
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it , starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it
"Eating out of the trash"
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, "When you know, you know"
And, "When you don't, you don't"
And all of the foes, and all of the friends
Have seen it before, they'll see it again
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong
But my mama told me, "It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

Her name was Kitty
Made her money being pretty and witty
They gave her the keys to this city
Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
I bought a ticket
She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
Looking back, I guess it was kismet
I waited by the stage door,
packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name,
then glowing like the end of a cigarette, wow, she came out
I said, "You're living my drеam"
Then she said to me
"Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never, ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten, so
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna"

Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign
In these stolen moments, the world is mine
There's nobody here, just us together
Keepin' me hot like July forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come late
'Cause, boy, we're gold, boy, we're gold
And I was like
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah
And a lust for life (
And a lust for life
And a lust for life (
And a lust for life
Keeps us alive (
Keeps us alive
Keeps us alive (
Keeps us alive
And a lust for life (
And a lust for life
And a lust for life (
And a lust for life
Keeps us alive (
Keeps us alive
Keeps us alive (
Keeps us alive

Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win
There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"

He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that,
he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
He used to call me poison
Like I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough

Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard?
Mosaic ceilings, painted tiles on the wall
I can't help but feel somewhat like my body marred my soul
Handmade beauty sealed up by two man-made walls
And I'm like
When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Therе's a tunnel under Ocean Boulеvard
There's a girl who sings "Hotel California"
Not because she loves the notes or sounds that sound like Florida
It's because she's in a world, preserved, only a few have found the door
It's like Camarillo, only silver mirrors, running down the corridor
Oh, man
When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?

“Carmen” is the 9th track from Lana Del Rey’s album Born to Die.
Darlin', darlin' doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling 'em she's having fun
She says, "You don't wanna be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't wanna get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin"
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning
Carmen, Carmen, stayin' up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly, how disarmin' you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream, Coney Island queen

You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

Love (
Yeah
), I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger (
Hey
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch (
Yeah
), from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil (
Hey
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries (
Hey
) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined
Love (
Yeah
), is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against ya (
Hey
And you just stay lined up, yeah
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches

It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time,
all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away,
it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to
watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Mike Shinoda
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you
Mike Shinoda
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

Should've stayed, were there signs I ignored?
Can I help you not to hurt anymore?
We saw brilliance when the world was asleep
There are things that we can have but can't keep
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well, I do
The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well, I do

I don't like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can't escape the gravity
Kiiara
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
To so much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

Your blades are sharpened with precision
Flashing your favorite point of view
I know you're waiting in the distance
Just like you always do, just like you always do
Already pullin' me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I
Let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hopin' for what I won't receive
Fallin' for the promise of the emptiness machine
The emptiness machine
Goin' around like a revolver
It's been decided how we lose
'Cause there's a fire under the altar
I keep on lyin' to, I keep on lyin' to
Already pullin' me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control, I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem
Mike Shinoda
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Mike Shinoda
Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting (
Distracting
), reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (
My own reflection
It's haunting (
It's haunting
) how I can't seem

In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

Chester Bennington
When this began
) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
I was confused
) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
Inside of me
) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
Nothing to lose
) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
Mike Shinoda
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
Chester Bennington
And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
I was confused
) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
So what am I?
) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me
Nothing to lose
) Nothin' to gain, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

“Battle Symphony” is about personal conflict, focusing on the sensation of hearing voices inside your head as if they were a symphony.
I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies
When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony
They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed but
I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin
Chester Bennington
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right
beneath my skin
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watchin' you too
Right inside your skin

I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors then rapidly
You just turn around and start askin' me
About things that you want back from me
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
Mike Shinoda
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
You'll see it's not meant to be
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head
Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you shoulda known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now you see, how quiet it is all alone

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Don't you come back no more
Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from
Pusha T
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye,
woo

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway
Just like before
Chester Bennington
& Mike Shinoda
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

It's pourin' in, you're laid on the floor again
One knock at the door and then
We both know how the story ends
You can't win if your white flag's out when the war begins
Aimin' so high but swingin' so low
Tryin' to catch fire but feelin' so cold
Hold it inside and hope it won't show
I'm sayin' it's not, but inside, I know
Today's gonna be the day you notice
'Cause I'm tired of explainin' what the joke is
This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps
bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the
Heavy is the crown
Turn to run, now look what it's become
Outnumbered, ten to one
Back thеn should've bit your tongue
'Cause thеre's no turnin' back this path once it's begun
You're already on that list
Say you don't want what you can't resist
Wavin' that sword when the pen won't miss
Watch it all fallin' apart like this

I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
But no one would listen, 'cause no one else cared
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
What am I leaving when I'm done here?
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating, I've shared what I made
I've never been perfect, but neither have you
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let somethin' shine
Goin' out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
Well, those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
'Cause honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that
green light
, I want it

Go for it
One, two
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek
They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, "Let's go out"
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Go back and tell it
Please, could you be tender?
And I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well, I guess I should go, yeah, I guess I should go
Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

Don't you think that it's
Boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again
Well, I'm bored
Because
I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasin' a million things I want
And I am
Only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showin' people how little we care
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah"
Pretty soon, I'll be getting
On my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city
Like they do in space
But my head's
Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm
Known?
And my
Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season, anyway
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing, I'm alright
It's just another graceless night
Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh-oh-oh
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

I hate the winter, can't stand the cold
I tend to cancel all the plans
But when the heat comes, something takes a hold
Can I kick it? Yeah, I can
My cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus
Forget all of thе tears that you've cried
It's ovеr
It's a new state of mind
Are you coming, my baby?
Acid green, aquamarine
The girls are dancing in the sand
And I throw my cellular device in the water
Can you reach me? No, you can't

In my head
I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

Break the news—you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe
I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I've stopped needing you

“Sober” is about “being a little bit involved with someone and it’s magic when you are out — you’re just king and queen of the weekend, you own the party.”
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
When you get to my high, when you get to
Night, midnight
Oh God, I'm clean out of air
In my lungs, it's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me
But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
We're king and queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care, but we care
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush

“Homemade Dynamite” describes the moment when you meet someone at a party and an explosive night follows.
A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally
Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome, right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Might get your friend to drive
But he can hardly see, ooh-ooh
We'll end up painted on the road, red and chrome
All the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying

A place in the city
A chair and a bed
I cover up all the mirrors
I can't see myself yet
I wear smoke like a wedding veil
Make a meal I won't eat
Step out into the street, alone in a sea
It comes over me
Oh, I'm missing you
Yeah, I'm missing you
And all the things we used to do
MDMA in the back garden, blow our pupils up
We kissed for hours straight, well, baby, what was that?
I remember saying then, "This is the best cigarette of my life"
Well, I want you just like that
Indio haze, we're in a sandstorm and it knocks me out
I didn't know then that you'd never be enough, oh
Since l was seventeen, I gave you everything
Now we wake from a dream, well, baby, what was that?
What was that?
Baby, what was that?

Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing
Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads
'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybе I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stonеd at the nail salon again
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe

During her Beats 1 Radio show about her album, Lorde said of “Sober II ”:
You asked if I was feeling it, I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning when I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home, but who am I?
Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses
We told you this was melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish is melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
And the terror and the horror
When we wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
And the terror and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
All the glamour and the trauma
And the fuckin' melodrama, whoa, whoa
All the gun fights and the lime lights
And the holy sick divine nights, whoa
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kiss and kill each other, whoa
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other, whoa

We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you
Till the veins run red and blue?
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow but we're brave
I love these roads where the houses don't change
Where we can talk like there's something to say
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

I've seen the devil
Down Sunset
In every place
In every face
Yeah
Yeah
Tell me, do you see her?  She's livin' her life
Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight
But if you knew her , she lives a lie
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised
Oh, I know what she needs
She just want the fame, I know what shе fiends
Give hеr a little taste, runnin' back to me
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh
Ooh, every night , she prays to the sky
Flashin' lights is all she ever wants to see
Beggin' on her knees to be popular
That's her dream, to be popular
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular
Just to be popular
Everybody scream 'cause she popular
She mainstream 'cause she popular
Never be free 'cause she popular

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, "Te amo"
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest
Then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie
But I don't let them play
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

Move to the music
I'm gonna find new drive
Damn, they work me so damn hard
Work by nine
Then off past five
And they work my nerves
That's why I cannot sleep at night (
You know you can do it

Strike a pose
Strike a pose
Vogue
Vogue
Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor
And here's what it's for, so
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow
You know you can do it

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open
Mmm-mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm-mmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm-mmm, give yourself to me
Mmm-mmm, you hold the key
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you, my heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen, when your heart's not open
Mmm-mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm-mmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm-mmm, give yourself to me
Mmm-mmm, you hold the key

I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new, hoo
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
next to mine
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fadin' fast
Been savin' it all for you cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

And you can dance
For inspiration
Come on
I'm waiting
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I want to dance with someone else

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
"You remind me of a younger me," I saw potential
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, "They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign"
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets

I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it
"Eating out of the trash"
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, "When you know, you know"
And, "When you don't, you don't"
And all of the foes, and all of the friends
Have seen it before, they'll see it again
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong
But my mama told me, "It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

(
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch
We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping, make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinkin' and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissin' anybody that's around us
I just wanna have fun tonight (
Blow up this shit tonight
Put me under the flashin' light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight (
Gonna blow up
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want

Allowed myself to be naive (

Me encanta
I took a sip and had a dream
And I woke up in Medellín (
¿Te gusta?
The sun was caressing my skin (
Dime
Another me could now begin (
Woo
Tranquila, baby, yo te apoyo
No hay que hablarnos mucho para entrar en rollo
Si quieres ser mi reina pues yo te corono
Y pa' que te sientes aquí tengo un trono
Te gusta cabalgar, eso está claro
Si sientes que voy rápido le bajo
Discúlpame, yo sé que eres Madonna
Pero te voy a demostrar cómo este perro te enamora

Hey, Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
Do you like to boogie-woogie?
Do you like to boogie-woogie?
Do you like to boogie-woogie?
Do you like my acid rock?
Hey, Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy
Music, music, music, music
Music, music, music, music, music
Music makes the people come together
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel
Don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie
It's like ridin' on the wind and it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in, got to have it every day

I'm outta time, and all I got is four minutes
Fikki-fikki, four minutes, ay
I'm outta time, and all I got is four minutes

I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll, uh, uh
Ah, well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, uh, mm
I want somebody to speed it up for me, then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?
Fikki-fikki, fikki-fikki, come on

Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe, please
Papa, don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach
, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, mm
He says that he's going to marry me
And we can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feelin' low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old, o-old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
A-a-all we need is somebody to lean on

Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee give in
What can I do to get the money?
We ain't got the money, we ain't getting out
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearing thin
All I need's relief
I need, I need some sympathy, yeah
Look at me

We could never get free

All of my life been wading in
Water so deep, now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long, how long 'til we have a friend?
Coming down, feeling like a battery hen
Waves won't break 'til the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise?
What will I do without my dreams?

Onazo, yeah

They told me everybody's 15 minutes in a different timezone
And since I have it at the moment, you the one I wanna shine my light on
Get your life, get your life, little mama, won't you get your life on?
Ain't nothing cooler than the wrong moves, when you do 'em to the right song, the right song
Let's shoot this movie and put the shit on repeat
I hope this Mary's not making you fall asleep
Before we hit the road, put our phones on silent
Nobody's tryna bring sand to the beach

Love don't come easy at all
I miss you so much, I miss you so much
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, ooh, whoa
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon, we'll be together
He was a dreamer at heart
Chasing the stars, chasing the stars
Wings spread to the sun
I miss you so much, I miss you so much
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart break, ooh, whoa

The fifth track off Major’s third album Peace Is the Mission. According to Diplo
Oh, my, my, my, what you do to me?
Like lightning when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heaven and stars above
Oh, lord, have mercy, I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained, I need love
You charge me up like electricity
Jump-start my heart with your love
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful

Make the dope boys smile they don't need binoculars
Make a nigga wanna pull out choppas
Brrap, brrap, brrap they got ya

Jason Newsted
Goddamn coward! Get your ass out of that trench!
Move, move, move, move, move!
Get out of here! Oh, fuck!
We're all fucking trapped here, we're all fucking trapped here!
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman, he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your
master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

New blood joins this earth and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time, the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow onto his own, that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

Make his fight, on the hill, in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run, through the endless grey
On they fight, for they’re right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive, through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone, except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Slaves, Hebrews born to serve to the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word, live in fear
Faith of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait, something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written, so let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
To kill the first-born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now, let my people go,
land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long, hail to fire
So let it be written, so let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
To kill the first-born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Metallica’s gut-wrenching “Ride The Lightning” is about spending your final moments in an electric chair. The title was taken from Stephen King’s The Stand.
Guilty as charged, but damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say, "I'll take your life from you"?
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold, as I watch death unfold
Consciousness, my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire, ooh
Yeah
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em man, white-knuckle tight
Through black and white
Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire
Yeah

Hey , I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey , I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They , they betray
I'm your only true friend now
They , they'll betray
I'm forever there
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
Sad but true
You , you're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You , you're my mask
You're the one who's blamed
Do , do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do , do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

Halls of justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay,
nothing can save you
Justice is lost,
justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real
Apathy their stepping stone,
so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity,
so deceiving
Through your eyes, their light burns,
hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

Blackened is the end, winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth, never a rebirth
Evolution's end, never will it mend
Never
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of Earth, terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill, nothing left to kill
Never seen before, breathing nevermore
Never
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blackened

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves, and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend, and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"?
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

And the road becomes my bride
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah
Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah
And the Earth becomes my throne
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one
And my ties are severed clean
The less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign

Lay beside me
And tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear
To make my demons run
The door is locked now
But it's opened if you're true
If you can understand the me
Then I can understand the you
Lay beside me
Under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night
We share this paralyze
The door cracks open
But there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still
But there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery

By the last breath, the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now, you've got some company
Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah, yeah
You've been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confession now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

Late at night, all systems go, you've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it, oh, so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
with your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell, and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said, "Stand and deliver, or the devil, he may take you"
, yeah
I took all of his money, and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me, no, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy
Musha ring um a do um a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Bein' drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' money with me, but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven, yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols, and I shot him with both barrels, yeah
Musha ring um a do um a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah-heh, whiskey in the jar-o

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene, uh
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one?
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one, uh
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do," uh
"And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" , hey
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Uh, she says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and for forty nights,
the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
She told my baby we danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

Ow!
Cha!
Shoo-ca-choo-ca!
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Ooh
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over
You're too low to get under
You're stuck in the middle
And the pain is thunder
It's too high to get over
You're too low to get under
You're stuck in the middle
And the pain is thunder
I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever, but nothin' he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

Think about, um, the generations, and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and children's children so that they, they, they s— they know it's a better world for them. Think they can make it a better place
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
*overlapping voices*
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang, bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
*** me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, **** me,
don't you, "Black or white" me

Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin'

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard,
a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

Why?
Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say why , why
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
If they say why , why
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it , beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Show them how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it , just beat it
Just beat it , just beat it
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Stevie Wonder
There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
James Ingram
Tina Turner
We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth,
you know
Love is all we need
Diana Ross
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true, we'll make a better day
Just you and me
Al Jarreau
Well, send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand

Siedah Garrett
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on,
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you
Siedah Garrett
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you
Siedah Garrett
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (
), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do" (
I do
This thing can't go wrong
, this feeling's so strong
Well
my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

Ah, your butt is mine, gon' tell you right, ah
Just show your face in broad daylight, ah
I'm tellin' you on who I feel, ah
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone, ah, shamone
Lay it on me, ah, alright
Ah, I'm givin' you on count to three, ah
To show your stuff or let it be, ah
I'm tellin' you, just watch your mouth, ah
I know your game, hah, what you're about, ah
Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me, that's really true, ah
But my friend, you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone
You know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?

Another massive hit from Bad, this track got to number one in the US.
Hee-hee, ooh
Go on, girl, aaow!
Hee
Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me, baby, and tell me twice
That you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
Uh, uh
I like this feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

You'll never make me stay, so take your weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time, you won't seduce me
She's saying "That's okay, hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back", she trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

But dad, this is the best part!
No!
Dad, this is the best part, come on

Right, too late? Sure, eat this
Aaow!
Aaow!
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, "I ain't second to none"

Haha, I don't know
Bet you wanna try
Every time you see, hahaha
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember
Back in the fall?
We'd be together
All day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands?
In each other's eyes
We'd stare , tell me
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Janet Jackson
Hoo!
No!
Hoo! Hee!
Hoo
Ah, tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgustin'
So what does it mean? Damn it
Kickin' me down
I got to get up, ah
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it
Hee, hoo-hoo
Michael Jackson
Peek in the shadow (
Hoo-hoo!
I come into the light (
Hee-hee!
If you tell me I'm wrong (
Hee-hee!
Then you better prove you're right
And you're sellin' out souls
But I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?
Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin

Ah, I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me
She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah
I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said like it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

Got to be there
Got to be there in the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there
Got to be there, bring her good times
And show her that she's my girl
Oh, what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know she loves me
'Cause when I look in her eyes, I realize
I need her sharing her world beside me
So I've got to be there
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she's my girl
When she says, "Hello, world!"
I need her sharing the world beside me
That's why I've got to be there
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me
She's home
Yeah

You know, I was, I was wondering, you know
If you could keep on because
The force has got a lot of power and it
It make me feel like a
It, it make me feel like, woo!
Lovely is the feeling now
Fever, temperature's rising now
Power is the force, the vow
That makes it happen
It asks no questions why, ooh
So get closer to my body now
Just love me 'til ya don't know how, ooh
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love
I wanna rock with you
Dance you into day
I wanna rock with you
We're gonna rock the night away
Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

What about sunrise? What about rain?
What about all the things that you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields? Is there a time?
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine?
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh
What have we've done to the world? Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields? Is there a time?
What about all the dreams that you said was yours and mine?
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

Invincible.
Michael Jackson
Got-t-t-t me, that girl
Oh, man! Look at that girl right there!
Goodness gracious! Uh! That girl's fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine, too!
She is banging!
Ooh, she's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Ah-uh-uh-uh-uh, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
Pfft, You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right!
Shamone, then, shamone
Watch
I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that
I, I, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk, the way I talk
I cannot explain
The things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
So stay with me, fulfill my dreams
I'll be all you'll need

Da de-de de-da, lda de-da-dum
Da de -de -de -da, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Butterflies inside
All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my call
When I'm tryna get through
Keep me wonderin' why when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
'Cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it
'Cause baby, every time I love you
In and out my life, in, out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, in, out, baby
So baby, yes, love never felt so good
Baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it's never mine, not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me

We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A

The truth is bulletproof, there's no foolin' you
I don't dress the same
Me and who you say I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
'Cause that's for chasin' cars
Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts
And goin' way too far
I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'causе I
used to be young
Take onе, pour it out, it's not worth cryin' 'bout
The things you can't erase
Like tattoos and regrets,
words I never meant
And ones that got away
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
And took another road
Turns out crowded rooms empty out as soon
There's somewhere else to go, oh-oh

It's our party, we can do what we want (
Ear Drummers
, ooh)
It's our party, we can say what we want (
Mike WILL Made-It
, ooh)
It's our party, we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want
It's our party, we can do what we want
It's our party, we can say what we want
It's our party, we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want (
Right about now
, ayy)
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "hell no"?
'Cause we gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party
Dancin' with Molly
Doin' whatever we want
This is our house, this is our rules

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away

La, la, la-la, la
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes
Forever and ever, no more
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
La, la, la-la, la

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name,
only "baby"
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
Close your eyes

I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
"You'll never reach it"
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost with no direction
My faith is shaken
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

“Adore You” opens Miley Cyrus' Bangerz on a soft note, giving no hint to the chaos to come.
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Hey
Oh, oh, mm
Baby, baby, yeah
Are you listenin'?
Wonderin' where you've been
All my life
I just started livin'
Ooh, oh, baby
Are you listenin'? Oh-oh
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm cryin' out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me, uh
I feel like I'm standin' with an army
Of men armed with weapons
Hey, oh

It’s a strong and direct statement of Cyrus’s political commitment to feminism and LGBTQ+ movements,
Hallelujah, I'm a freak, I'm a freak, hallelujah
Every day of the week, I'ma do ya like I want to
I'm a Nile crocodile, a piranha
Oh my God, she got the power
Oh, look at her, she got the power
So, so, so
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty
, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Hallelujah, I'm a witch, I'm a witch, hallelujah
Swish swish, I'm a three-point shooter, I blow through ya
Like a hot wind out in the bayou, yah

Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Miley Cyrus
Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (
I can't control it
I try to replace it with city lights
I'll never escape it, I need the high
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it
You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Miley Cyrus
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

Mmm, mmm, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Ooh, yeah
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
It's been months
And for some reason I just
And I'm stronger than this, yeah
No more walking 'round with my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah (
Mr. Worldwide
), oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life (
Ne-yo
), hey, hey, hey
Let's get it now
This the last twenty dollars I got
But I'ma have a good time ballin' tonight
Tell the bartender, "Line up some shots"
'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
And told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk , dirty dance
She a freaky girl  and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, "Wanna ride out?" And she said, "Yes"
We didn't go to church but I got blessed

You, yeah, you, you
You, yeah, you, you
You, yeah, you, you, you
Ooh, it's something about
I can't figure it out
It's something about her
Said, ooh, it's something about
Kind of woman that want you, but don't need you
Hey, I can't figure it out
It's something about her
'Cause she walk like a boss, talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss, do what a boss do
She got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kinda girl I need, oh
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Won't you come and spend a little time?
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Ooh, the way you shine
Miss independent

The single started radio play the week of February 4, 2007.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
Hmm
Want to, but I can't help it, I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move, but I like it
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

What's up with that rabbit? What's up with that rabbit?
She good with it, she good with that ass all over my carrot
Took her straight to Paris, puss before the karat
Soon as I pull it down, I swear they wanna get married
Damn, goddamn, I swear these girls, goddamn
Damn, damn, I swear, my nigga, goddamn
First, they start off bougie, then I'm like, "Is that yo booty?"
Then she let me touch her, now we fucking
She knows, she knows
She knows, she knows
She knows, I been waiting just to take her down
Oh, yeah
I told my partner, "Ne-Yo , hit me when she come around
And I'ma tear that body up"
A-A-Anytime she walk in, she tear the party up
Time and time, time again, any city, any club
She know what's up , she know she dope
Body like drugs and I need another dose
Baby putting on a show
No matter how much she do, I want some more
She got class with that ass when she hit the floor
She knows, oh, yeah, that's for sure

Woah-oh, woah
Woah-oh, woah
Mmm, she's starin' at me
I'm sittin' wonderin' what she's thinking
Mmm, nobody's talkin'
'Cause talkin' just turns into screamin', oh
And now as I'm yellin' over her, she yellin' over me
All that that means is neither of us are listening
And what's even worse, that we don't
Even remember why we're fighting
So both of us are mad for nothing
Nothing
Nothing
But we won't let it go for nothing
Nothing, it should be nothing
To a love like what we got
Oh, baby I know sometimes it's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now?
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
And I don't want you to go to bed
No, I don't wanna go to bed
And I don't want you to go to bed
Oh, no, no, no

Yeah, uh-huh!
Your boy Juicy J
She bad, yeah
In case you didn't know, Juicy that nigga
I keep me two hoes like that nigga Jack Tripper

And I kill that pussy like my name Jack the Ripper
Baby, I'm horny and I ain't too proud to beg
Instead show me the bed
Early morning breakfast and head
And I got Tina, Tasha and Toya, I call ‘em the triple threat
All them bitches be soaking wet
This the first night them bitches met
You know from the moment she turn around
She know how to back it up and drop it down
She know she what all the fellas looking at
Cause they know soon as her song come on it's a wrap
And she loves the attention
That she get when she moves, yeah
Showin' out with her home girls
Hypnotizing all the dudes, oh

Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido, yeah
Hey, yay
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

The first single from In Utero, “Heart-Shaped Box” details the battle of wills inherent to a new relationship when one doesn’t quite feel so strongly about another person.
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your highness, I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to've met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours
I like you
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything about a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids
Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours
I like you
You, you, you
You, you
Ahh!

I'm so happy, 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
Broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is every day, for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze, 'cause I've found God
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there
And I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good

Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blowtorch
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

Rape me
Rape me, my friend
Rape me
Rape me again
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one
Hate me
Do it, and do it again
Waste me
Rape me, my friend
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one
My favorite inside source
I'll kiss your open sores
Appreciate your concern
You're gonna stink and burn

Underneath the bridge, tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped have all become my pets
And I'm livin' off of grass and the drippings from the ceilin'
It's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any feelings
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm

Cobain’s lyrics poke fun at the people outside of the underground music scene that began showing up at Nirvana shows after the release of the group’s debut album, Bleach.
Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs, and he
Likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs,
and he
Likes to sing along
and he
likes to shoot his gun
, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say, "Yeah"
We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs, and he
Likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
, and he
Likes to sing along
and he
likes to shoot his gun,
but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means,
and I say, "Yeah"

I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do, think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free
I'm standin' in your line
I do, hope you have the time
I do, pick a number too
I do, keep a date with you
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free

We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago
Oh, no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

What else should I be?
All apologies
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
What else could I write?
I don't have the right
What else should I be?
All apologies
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married
Buried
I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything's my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua sea foam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn
Chokin' on the ashes of her enemy

Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Tradin' off and takin' turns
I don't regret a thing
And I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you
Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowin' fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fightin' jealousy
Until it's fucking gone
I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you

Kurt Cobain
Come on, people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Mmm
When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Never met a wise man
If so, it's a woman
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you

This is a cover of “In The Pines” by American folk and blues singer, songwriter and guitar virtuoso Lead Belly, who Kurt Cobain describes as his “favorite performer” while introducing the song.
Krist Novoselic
Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening
What is it?
This was written by (
Uh, what?
) my favorite performer. Our favorite performer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
Oh! And there's a donation basket. Kurt wants to buy Lead Belly's guitar
Oh yeah, this guy representing the Lead Belly estate wants to sell me Lead Belly's guitar for five hundred thousand dollars
We're passing a basket if anyone-
Yeah, I even asked David Ges— Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me and he wouldn't do it. Okay
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm havin' fun
I think I'm dumb
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
My heart is broke, but I have some glue
Help me inhale
and mend it with you
We'll float around and hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
And have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothin' burn, wake me up

I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, 'fraid, ghost
Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three
She said , she said
She said , she said
She said , she said
She said , she said
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, 'fraid, ghost

I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic royalty
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally
I'm so tired, I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic royalty
I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids

“You Know You’re Right,” recorded in January of 1994, was the last song Nirvana finished as a group.
I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
And always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
Hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
Steaming soup against her mouth
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love herself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
Always knew it'd come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold
If she floats then she is not
A witch like we've thought
A down payment on another
One at Salem's lot
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants
That legendary divorce is such a bore
As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead, I had a dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before

Hey, hey
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Oh, oh
) I'm doin' this tonight
You're
) Probably gonna start a fight
) Know this can't be right
Hey, baby, come on
) Loved you endlessly
And
) You weren't there for me
) Now, it's time to leave
And make it alone
Justin Timberlake
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby,
bye, bye, bye
Justin Timberlake
J.C. Chasez
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me, but it
ain't no lie
Baby
, bye, bye, bye
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
Might sound crazy, but it
ain't no lie
Baby
, bye, bye, bye (
Oh, oh

It's some kind of love, it's some kind of fire
I'm already up, but you lift me higher
You know I'm not wrong, you know I'm not lyin'
We do it better, yeah, we do it better, yeah
I don't mind if the world spins faster
The music's louder, the waves get stronger
I don't mind if the world spins faster
Faster, faster
Just let me take you to a better place
I'm gonna make you kiss the sky tonight
Yeah, if you let me show the way
I'm so excited to see you excited
I'll take you to a better place, yoo-hoo
And, baby, you can love me on the way
We're flyin' up to outer space
I'm so excited to see you excited, yeah
Yeah, ooh, oh
J.C. Chasez
You like the bass down low, I wanna lose control
I wanna dance all night, you like it nice and slow
Don't want it any other way, tell all your friends you're gonna stay
When we're together, you know that we do it better

Ooh, yeah
You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in “no man, no cry”
Maybe that's why
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what? It's gonna be me
J.C. Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick & Justin Timberlake
You've got no choice, babe
But to move on and you know
There ain't no time to waste
You're just
too blind  to see
But in the end, you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me
why

“Tearin' Up My Heart” was on *NSYNC’s self-titled debut album.
Justin
It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you (
Hey yeah
with Chris
Baby, I don't understand
Just why we can't be lovers
Things are getting out of hand
Tryin' too much, but
baby, we can win
with Chris
Let it go
If you want me,
girl, let me know
I am
down on my knees
I can't take it anymore
It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
Oh, alright

Merry Christmas
Happy holidays
Merry Christmas
(Hey, yeah
, oh-oh-oh)
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Happy holidays
Ooh, yeah
with All
We've been waiting
All year for this night
And the snow is glistening on the trees outside
And all the stockings
Are hung by the
fireside
Waiting for Santa to arrive
And all the love will show
'Cause everybody knows
It's Christmas time and
All the kids will see
The gifts under the tree
It's the best time of year for the family

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were actin' so strange, mm
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change
Was it somethin' I said
To make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold?
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now
Justin
I've been sittin' here
Can't get you off my mind (
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishin' I could touch your face (
Touch your face
But the truth remains, you're

Dirty pop
with JC
Sick and tired of hearin' all these people talk about
"What's the deal with this pop life?
And when is it gonna fade out?"
The thing you got to realize what we're doin' is not a trend
We got the gift of
melody
We're gonna bring it 'til the end
Come on now
It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive or what I wear around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize that it's just about respect
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear, and where I go, and why
All that matters
Is that you get hyped and we'll do it to you every time
Come on now
Do you ever wonder why
This music gets you high?
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock (
When your body starts to rock
Baby, you can't stop (
You can't stop
And the music's all you got (
Come on now
Pop

N Sync was already super popular in Germany because of this single in 1996. Two years later, it gained some traction in the U.S. and led to the phenomenon of this boyband.
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what to do now
'Cause
Lance:
Joey:
Justin:
JC:
Chris:
All:
I want you back
It's hard to say I'm sorry
It's hard to make the things I did undone
A lesson I've learned too well for sure
So don't hang up the phone now
I'm tryna figure out just what to do
I'm goin' crazy without you
Justin
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed (
Yeah
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back

I was hangin' with the fellas
Saw you with your new boyfriend, it made me jealous
I was hopin' that I'd never see you with him
But it's all good, 'cause I'm glad that I met him
Heh
'Cause now I know the competition's very slim to none
And I can tell by lookin' that he's not the one
He's not the type you said you liked
His style is wack, clothes are bad
Come on, girl, let him go
I want you back
Call me a
hater
if you
want to
But I only hate on him 'cause I want you
Say I'm
trippin'
if you
feel like
But you without me ain't right
You can say I'm
crazy,
if you
want to
That's true--
I'm crazy 'bout you
You could say I'm breakin' down inside (
Inside
'Cause I can't see you with another guy
It makes me ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him
Oh, it makes me ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him

Oh, oh
When the visions around you
Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you
Are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength
I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call
Was standing there all along
Justin
And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Til' the day my life is through
This I promise you
This I promise you
I've loved you forever
In lifetimes before
And I promise you never
Will you hurt anymore

You know, you have to be free in this world
You have to glow, you gotta drip, you gotta, like, express yourself, you know?
But you can't do that when you give everybody your power
They'll do whatever they want with you
You know, you can't do that
Ernähr' mich von Glyphosat und UVA
Lass' mich berieseln von dem Größenwahn
Was nicht schön ist, wird schön gesagt
Pflanze auf Beton, ich komm' im Garten an
Ich versicher' meine Artefakte
Bin gespannt, welches der viralen TikToks später im Museum landet
Bleibt die Seele odеr nur die Maske?
Ist es Kunst und ist еs das dann nur, wenn es als Kunst verpackt ist?
Stell mir 'ne Selbstdiagnose: ADHS
Gib mir alles, aber nimm mir nicht das Handy weg
Wie viele Talkshows muss ich schau'n, bis ich die Welt verstanden hab'?
Das lyrische Ich frisst sich am liebsten an Dystopien satt
Gib mir das Mic gib mir den Raum, gib mir die Aufmerksamkeit
Gib mir das High, gib mir das Low, ich hab' nicht mehr viel Zeit
Gib mir den Schlüssel aus der Matrix, ich will alles draußen seh'n
Alles, damit ich die Zeit nach mir überleb'

If you're lookin' for perfect, well, I ain't
Sometimes a sinner more than saint
Seems like I spend most my time
In the gray between the black and white
Fly with angels, run with demons
Some days I'm just breakin' even
Just 'cause I'm not the Sunday mornin' crowd
Don't mean that I'm more lost than found
And, oh-oh-oh
It might sound a little crazy
But, oh-oh-oh
God talks to me
I heard Him in momma's prayers back when I didn't care
He was tellin' me He was right there
And He spoke through the sound of the crash with that metal and glass
Sayin', "Son, you're goin' way too fast"
You might not believe
But God talks to me
Yeah, God talks to me

Yeah
Kid Ace on this bitch, so I know he fuckin' with it
Yeah
In the trap, got flavors, pick and choose, yeah, we got options
Money stuffed up in these 'Miris sloppy, 20K off rhymin'
Ain't worried about no bitch, I be in that mode, locked in, grindin'
I fucked up the streets, put a chokehold on the trap, gettin' them boxes in
I stayed down for this
Shinin' with the lights off, all my jewelry lit
'Lenci shoes cost a couple racks, I'm walkin' on your rent
I don't fuck with niggas, these niggas might tell, I don't need no codefendant
Paper keep on pilin' up, they wonderin' how I ran it up
Every time, I lost it, I shook back, it's the hustle in me
He got it all, look, he lost it, every box came in, I offed it
Fresh to death, ain't in no coffin
Gelato smokin' got me coughin'
Jewelry wet as hell, look like I came straight out the faucet
Too much money I be gettin', I feel like the feds watchin'
Better watch who you keep 'round you, niggas tell on everybody
I took risks and I got rich, in the trap stackin' my profit
Really get it in, lately I been boxed in, feel like Roddy
Juggin' turkey bags, really havin', you think I move bricks
Got several spots, two hundred gone one day, I got the trap lit
Still made it far, ain't never graduate, got more money than the teachers
Slammin' 'bows off in the trap, gettin' it off quick, nigga, I can teach you, yeah

I was born my mother's son
When I hit the ground, I was on the run
All my life, I've played the fool
I've been breakin' hearts and breakin' rules
I can't change my evil ways
You can't change my evil ways
No matter what the good book says
I can't change my evil ways no more, no more
Evil ways
My evil ways
Evil ways
I've been accused of hit and run
But all the same, I had my fun
Don't turn your back when I'm with you
'Cause I'll steal your chickens and your sister too
I can't change my evil ways
You can't change my evil ways
No matter what the good book says
I can't change my evil ways no more, no more
Evil ways
My evil ways
Evil ways
My evil ways

Oh oh oh oh
Oh ooh
When the visions around you
Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you
Are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength
I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call

And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong

Okay, baby what's it gon' take for you to be my lady?

Your lil' sister keep yelling, "Nelly, I wish you would"
But you're hesitating, debating whether or not it's real
I ain't shooting game, boo, I'm just telling you how I feel
I'm digging everything about you, your hips and the way they sway

Can this be true?
Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
with Chris
I never thought that love could feel like this
And then you change my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? It's a miracle
Justin
Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret
that I
never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you (
A little more time
Yes he did, baby

Justin
Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?
You know I like you, right?
But would you be my girlfriend?
Listen
I don't know why you care (
Why you thinkin' 'bout him, mama?
He doesn't even know you're there (
He ain't even paying attention
No no
'Cause he don't love your eyes (
Nah
And he don't love your smile (
Nah
Girl, you know that ain't fair (
C'mon
Justin
In the middle of the night (
Mmh
Is he gonna be by your side? (
No no
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know 'cause things ain't clear
And baby, when you cry
Is he gonna stand by your side?
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea

A super conceptual song about paranoia surrounding the rapture occurring upon the turnover to the year 2000, awkwardly combined with Texan-like space travel talk.
Riprock, AG, come in, over
Yo, turn me up, I wanna be heard
And the future looks bright
'Specially when we rip it in half
with *NSYNC
Here it comes, millennium
And everybody's talkin' 'bout Jerusalem
Is this the beginning or beginning of the end?
Well I've got other thoughts, my friend
See,
And if you're in the mood to take
Then strap on a suit and get
If you wanna fly
Come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly
Come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby

Why-yi-yi, yippie-yi-yay, yippie-yi-yo, yippie-yi-yo

Oh oh oh oh
Cuando sientas tristeza
Que no puedas calmar
Cuando haya un vacío
Que no puedas llenar
Te abrazaré
Te haré olvidar
Lo que te hizo sufrir
No vas a caer
Justin
Si siente un frío tu corazón
Seré tu abrigo, tu ilusión
Hasta ya no respirar
Yo te voy a amar
Yo te voy a amar
Yo siempre te he amado
Y, amor, yo estaré
Por siempre a tu lado
Nunca me alejaré
Prometo mi amor
Te juro ante Dios
Nunca te voy a faltar
Tu corazón

Baby, you're not the only one
Oh, ooh ooh
Oh yeah, yeah
Hey yeah
I see the things he does to you
All the pain that he puts you through
And I see what's really going on
Staying out at night while you're by the phone
with Justin
Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
See I would give you love
Baby, you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it, here's my heart
No strings attached

I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that?
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching?
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
Watching reruns of
Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu?  Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

I have nightmares each week 'bout that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
But I hold onto every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough
And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong
The arguments that I've won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone, and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

Lacy, oh Lacy, skin like puff pastry
Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell?
Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies
Did I ever tell you that I’m not doin' well?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time
Watching, hidden in plain sight
And ooh, I try, I try, I try
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere
The sweetest torture one could bear
Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin’ it lately
I feel your compliments likе bullets on skin
Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnatе
Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots
You got the one thing that I want
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
Try to rationalize, people are people
But it's like you're made of angel dust

One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?
I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

I am light as a feather, I'm as stiff as a board
I pay attention to things that most people ignore
And I'm alright with the movies
That make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty, that's for sure
And I am built like a mother and a total machine
I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean
And I make light of the darkness
I've got sun in my motherfuckin' pocket, best believe
Yeah, you know me, I
Forgive, and I forget
I know my age and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American
I am light as a feather, I'm as fresh as the air
Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair
I got class and integrity
Just like a goddamn Kennedy, I swear
With love to spare, I
Forgive and I forget
I know my age and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American bitch

I want it to be, like, messy
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody
The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wondеr if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again
All the things I did
Just so I could call you minе
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care
I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me
Started followin' me
And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos, I can't stand it
Oh God, I sound crazy

Cat got my tongue
And I don't think I get along with anyone
Blood runnin' cold
I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke
And I hate all my clothes
Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones
So I guess I should go
The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know
I know, I know
I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside, it's social suicide
It's social suicide, wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
Ah, ah, ah
I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy
Sеarchin' "how to start a conversation?" on a website
I talkеd to this hot guy, swore I was his type
Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like, the whole night
Everything I do is tragic
Every guy I like is gay
The morning after I panic
Oh, God, what did I say?

Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done
Another thing I ruined I used to do for fun
Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
Another conversation with nothing good to say
I thought it, so I said it, took it 'cause I can
Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign
Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Makin' the bed
And every night, I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
Where I'm drivin' through the city and the brakes go out on me
I can't stop at the red light, I can't swerve off the road
I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery, and I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined

Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff
'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand

Hey
Haven't heard from you in a couple of months
But I'm out right now and I'm all fucked up
And you're callin' my phone, you're all alone
And I'm sensing some undertone
And I'm right here with all my friends
But you're sending me your new address
And I know we're done, I know we're through
But, God, when I look at you
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts
Like blah-blah-blah
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine

Master manipulator
God, you're so good at what you do
Come for me like a savior
And I'd put myself through hell for you
Hear all the rumors lately
That you always denied
And I fell for you like water
Falls from the February sky
But now the current's stronger
No, I couldn't get out if I tried
But you convinced me, baby
It was all in my mind
And now you got me thinkin'
Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changing you is possible
No, love is never logical
You built a giant castle
With walls so high I couldn't see
The way it all unraveled
And all the things you did to me
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh

I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay
My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay
Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Double OT
I'm a new three
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', oh-ooh
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you

Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band"
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend

Mm-mm
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mm
Yeah (
Hey
My mama called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations"
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it
Yeah, we made it
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like an addict, yeah
I'm surrounded by twenty bad bitch, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yeah
Everyone countin' on me drop the ball, yeah
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eye

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Needless to say, I keep a check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Needless to say, I'm keeping a check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

Ooh,
I fall apart
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah
She told me that I'm not enough
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh,
didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh woah
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh woah

Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin’ up
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin'
I know it piss you off to see me winnin'
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ , yeah
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Everywhere I go
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo
750 Lambo in the Utah snow
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared
Before I dropped
Stoney,
none of y'all really cared
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit
Used to have a lot, but I got more now
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery
Tell me that it's all okay
I've been waitin' on this all damn day
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to—
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands, I just wanna go

Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs somethin' to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

Yeah, yeah
Mmm, ayy
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top
Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"
Goddamn, I love paper like I'm Michael Scott
I can do things that your man can not
Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped
Even though my final form ain't unlocked
I'm so ahead of you muhfuckas
How you comprehend what you ain't understandin'?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home

I've been looking for someone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

'Cause I can't take it no more
No, you ain't like them bitches, tell them hoes, "Adios"
And you can drop your panties, leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor, I swear we been here before
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section, tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl, this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up
The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in a Lexus, made love in a Lexus
I know you remember
Tell me, is that déjà vu?
'Cause you want me and I want you
Tell me, is that déjà vu?
'Cause, baby, it ain't nothin' new, nah
Tell me, is that déjà vu?
'Cause you want me and I want you
Tell me, is that déjà vu?
'Cause, baby, this ain't nothin' new, oh

You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?
I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
Like I'm the only one
Why'd you throw them stones if you
Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with a view
I thought you knew
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work," hell, I had some help
You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumbling
Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
Already lost the game that you been runnin'
Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
You think that you're so innocent
After all the shit you did
I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
Can't wash our hands of this

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floatin' around in ecstasy
don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm havin' a good time
Havin' a good time
I'm a shootin' star, leapin' through the sky like a tiger
Defyin' the laws of gravity
I'm a racin' car, passin' by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stoppin' me
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you
Don't stop me now
I'm havin' such a good time, I'm havin' a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Don't stop me now
) 'Cause I'm havin' a good time
Don't stop me now
) Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

A duet about how the pressure on our lives makes us nearly crumble. The collaboration emerged from a hectic day of partying and composing by David Bowie and the four members of Queen.
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
Freddie Mercury
Pressure
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you
No man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da
That's okay
Freddie Mercury
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

She keeps Moët et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake", she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime, an invitation you can't decline
Caviar
and cigarettes
Well-versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Pa-pa-pa-pa
) Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Killer
Then again incidentally
Killer
If you're that way inclined
She's a killer queen

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love
And now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Can
anybody find me
Somebody to
love?
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me? (
Yeah, yeah
I have spent all my years in believin' you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody (
Somebody
Ooh, somebody (
Somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Yeah
I work hard (
He works hard
) every day of my life
I work 'till I ache my bones
At the end (
At the end of the day
) I take home
My hard-earned pay all on my own
Goes home, goes home on his own
I get down (
Down
) on my knees (
Knees
) and I start to pray (
Praise the Lord
'Till the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place, singin'
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street
Gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes
Gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

Ooh, let's go!
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway, the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm gonna get along
Without you, when you're gone?
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway, the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old-time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know, or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
adio
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah, blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise

Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you
And where do you go?
You've never seen nothing like it, no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size

A hand above the water
An angel reachin' for the sky
Is it raining in Heaven?
Do you want us to cry?
And everywhere the brokenhearted
On every lonely avenue
No one could reach them
No one but you
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you
Another tricky situation
I get to drowning in the blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well, what would you do?
Yes, it was such an operation
Forever payin' every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through

Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside, my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning
'Round the corner now
Outside, the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark, I'm aching to be free

I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self-satisfied, I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love
It's strange but it's true, yeah
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to be free
Oh, how I want to break free
But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby, can't you see?
I've got to break free

Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go around
Hey, I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before
I left my nursery, huh
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Hey, big woman
You made a bad boy out of me
Hey, hey, woo!
I've been singing with my band
Cross the water, cross the land
I've seen every blue-eyed
Floozy on the way, hey
But their beauty and their style
Went kinda smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
Come on

Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live
Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
Been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
Oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering round
But still come back to you
In rain or shine, you've stood by me girl
I'm happy at home

Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride it where I like
You say black, I say white
You say bark, I say bite
You say shark, I say, hey, man
Jaws
was never my scene
And I don't like
Star Wars
You say Rolls, I say Royce
You say God, Give me a choice!
You say Lord, I say, Christ!
I don't believe in Peter Pan
Frankenstein or Superman
All I wanna do is
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle

Queen’s tribute to Elvis Presley and the early rockabilly style. Surprisingly, it was written in only 10 minutes while Freddie was in the bathtub.
It topped the US charts in February 1980.
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
A-this thing
Called love
It cries
In a cradle all night
It swings
It jives
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
Woo, I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I can dim the lights and sing you songs
Full of sad things
We can do the tango, just for two
I can serenade and gently play
On your heart strings
Be your Valentino, just for you
Ooh love, ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight?"
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy
Ooh, let me feel
Your heartbeat
Ooh, can you feel my love heat?
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me how do you feel, right after all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command
"Ooh love, ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight?
Write my letter, feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone

Yeah!
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light, yeah
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight, yeah
Don't hear the bell, but you answer the call
Yeah, we're just waiting
For the hammer to fall
, yeah
Oh, every night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles
As your body decays
, yeah
Yeah, let the anaesthetic cover it all
You know it's time for the hammer to fall, yeah

There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Ooh
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh
Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?
Freddie Mercury
But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

In the year of '39 assembled here, the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day, and the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day, and they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weight
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darling, we'll away but, my love, this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Baby, your mind is a radio
Got a receiver inside my head
Baby, I'm tuned to your wavelength
Let me tell you what it says
Transmitter
Oh, picking up something good
Hey, radio head
The sound of a brand-new world
Look at my fingers, they vibrate
From their tip down down to my toes
Now I'm receiving your signal
We're gonna leave the land of noise
Transmitter
Oh, picking up something good
Hey,
radio head
The sound of a brand-new world
Radio head
The sound of a brand-new world

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it
"Eating out of the trash"
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, "When you know, you know"
And, "When you don't, you don't"
And all of the foes, and all of the friends
Have seen it before, they'll see it again
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong
But my mama told me, "It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

Her name was Kitty
Made her money being pretty and witty
They gave her the keys to this city
Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
I bought a ticket
She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
Looking back, I guess it was kismet
I waited by the stage door,
packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name,
then glowing like the end of a cigarette, wow, she came out
I said, "You're living my drеam"
Then she said to me
"Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never, ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten, so
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna"

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths,
he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us
Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us

A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent
Silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

Radiohead was in the middle of their 1996 tour when they were approached by director Baz Luhrmann to record a song meant for his upcoming film, Romeo + Juliet.
Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape
We escape
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell
Breaks loose
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill
And you can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules
And wisdom choke you

Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
And when it comes
It's so, so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

A fine example of Radiohead’s “post-grunge” / “pre-electronic” phase on The Bends.
Her green plastic watering can
For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic Earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

Please could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken
Voices in my head
What's that?
I may be paranoid, but not an android
What's that?
I may be paranoid, but not an android
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all
What's that?
I may be paranoid, but not an android
What's that?
I may be paranoid, but not an android
(Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na)

I'm the next act waiting in the wings
I'm an animal trapped in your hot car
I am all the days that you choose to ignore
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
I am a moth who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you because there are no others
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's all wrong, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

That there
That's not me
I go
Where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

“Weird Fishes/ Arpeggi” brandishes new drums behind its drain-circling arpeggios, but sounds every bit as massive in crescendoing as its live renditions suggested it might.
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me into phantoms
I follow to the edge
Of the earth
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this
Is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps

Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life

Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell
For what your dirty mind is thinking

Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
Then it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done
This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
A white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You

“Airbag” is the first song off OK Computer.
In the next world war, jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In a neon sign scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe
In a deep, deep sleep of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car, I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

Rihanna comforts her lover by telling him she will be there for him, in good times and bad. The umbrella is a metaphor for her support.
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh (
Good Girl Gone Bad
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Comin' down with the Dow Jones
Ayy, ayy, ayy
When the clouds come, we go,
we Roc-A-Fella (
Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy
We fly higher than weather
in G5's or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back (
Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy
With Little Miss Sunshine
, Rihanna, where you at?  (
Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy
You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Baby, 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said "I'll always be your friend"
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standin' side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go-ooh-oh

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Paul McCartney
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz
Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want

Yayo, yayo

Louis XIII, and it's all on me, nigga, you just bought a shot
Kamikaze, if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot

Like bra, bra, bra
Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my

Must be love on the brain

Feeling this way
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (

Mustard on the beat, ho!
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me somethin'"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Somethin' in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're livin'
It's not just something you take, it's given
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

“Kiss It Better” tells the story of a broken relationship. She is aware that no one does it like him so instead of arguing all night she ‘kisses it better’.
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Been waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You yell, but cha take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack?
Boy, ya know that you always do it right
Man, fuck yo pride
Just take it on back, boy, take it on back, boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what cha gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurtin' vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in yo eye
What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

In “Sex With Me”, Rihanna makes it clear that having sex with her is something unique; in fact, it’s luxurious and, according to her, “so amazing.”
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I cannot mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it
Hit it like you own it, I'ma hit it like I'm on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
Baby, I'ma pick your poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon' need it
I'm off that la-la
I'ma get it wet like jacuzzi, ah-yeah
And sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
So, when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take "no"
I love it when you do what you want 'cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we out late
We don't care what them people say
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So, baby, be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot, it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So, baby, be the life of the party
Together, we can just let go
Pretending like there's no one else here that we know
Slow dance, fall in love as the club track plays
We don't care what them people say

I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left
seein' red
on my own

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off, but I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time in this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mmm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mmm
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying, baby
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy?
Mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy?
Mercy on my heart
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride is all I got
I'm saying, baby

I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessin', yeah
Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better
Does it ever?
Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
Oh, I gotta ask
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name
, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah
I love it when you call
señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you know I love it when you call
señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah
But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool
, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up , liftin' me up
And tearin' me down , tearin' me down
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one

I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by
I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder, I wonder

Khalid
Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growin', nah
Wakin' up to headlines, filled with devastation again
My heart is broken, but I keep goin'
with Khalid
Pain, but I won't let it turn into
hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
Khalid
It's hard to sleep at night, knowin' what's outside
Feelin' hopeless
, I need focus
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no

Ah-ah, he-hey
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, he-hey
Ah-ah, ah-ah
He knows
Dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killin' me?
He knows, he knows
D-d-does he know
Another's hands have touched my skin?
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows
It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away (
I'm slippin' away
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone (
The pictures on my phone
She's not coming home (
I'm not comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
I know what you did last summer (
Ah-ah
Just lied to me, "There's no other" (
He-hey
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
I know what you did last summer (
Ah-ah
Look me in the eyes, my lover (
He-hey
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been

Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak, open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changin' our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feelin' your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinkin', baby
You  are bringin' out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

Are we gonna make it?
Is this gonna hurt?
Oh, we can try to sedate it
But that never works
Yeah
I start to imagine a world where we don't collide
It's making me sick, but we'll heal and the sun will rise
If you tell me you're leaving, I'll make it easy
It'll be okay
If we can't stop the bleeding, we don't have to fix it
We don't have to stay
I will love you either way
It'll be o—, be okay
Oh, the future we dreamed of
Is fading to black, oh
And, oh, thеre's nothing more painful
Nothing more painful, oh-woah
I start to imaginе a world where we don't collide
And it's making me sick, but we'll heal and the sun will rise

Oh, there she goes again, every morning, it's the same
You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standin'
You got me thinkin' what we could be 'cause
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams, you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinkin' we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
Need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then, I woke up to the cold air
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Where were you in the morning, baby?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

I saw you on a Sunday in a café
And all you did was look my way
And my heart started to race
And my hands started to shake, yeah
I heard you asked about me through a friend
And my adrenaline kicked in
Cause I've been askin' 'bout you, too
And now we're right here in this room
I get a little bit nervous around you
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
Get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Talk a little too much, yeah, around you
I talk a little too much, yeah
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you
I get a little self-conscious
Get a little excited
I get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe
We walked in the rain, a couple blocks to your apartment
You told me to come inside, caught me staring in your eyes
And I'm not usually like this
But I like what you're doing to me, ah, what you're doing to me

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anythin', when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down
I'm the one for a good time call
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, I feel the love
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly
Like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
But I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight, on for tonight

Come on, come on, turn the radio on

But I got you, baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long

Uh-oh, runnin' out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, I need another lover, be mine
'Cause I, I, I got stamina
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no, no, no
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no, no, no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Well, uh-oh, runnin' out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, runnin' now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
And oh yeah, runnin' through the waves of love
But I, I got stamina
And oh yeah, I'm runnin' and I've just enough
And uh-oh, I got stamina

Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me
Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling?
If you can't catch me, darling
Don't cr
, snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
Can't hold me close, baby
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on, let's go
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, baby
My snowman and me,
My snowman and me
Baby
Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey?
Without legs to run, honey
Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby?
If you don't have ears, baby

Up with it, girl

Dance with it, girl
Get with it, girl
Come on, come on, turn the radio on

Sean Paul
'Til I hit the dance floor (
Bada bang
Hit the dance floor (
Bada bang
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby
Just you and me
Sean Paul
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I don't need no money
You're worth more dan diamond, more dan gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus tek control
I don't need no money
You're worth more dan diamond, more dan gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outta control

I'm trying but I keep falling down
I cry out but nothing comes now
I'm giving my all and I know peace will come
I never wanted to need someone
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
And if you let go I'll float towards the sun
I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up
But when the fear comes and I drift towards the ground
I am lucky that you're around
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul

“Unstoppable” serves as an empowerment anthem which beat builds as the song progresses.
I'll smile, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear
Keep my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time, yeah-yeah
I put my armour on, show you how strong I am
I put my armour on, I'll show you that I am
I'm unstoppable, I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible, yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful, I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today
Breakdown, only alone I will cry out loud
You'll never see what's hiding out
Hiding out deep down, yeah-yeah
I know, I've heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I'm too afraid now, yeah

Up, I won't give up, I won't give up
I won't give up, I won't give up
And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least, that's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

As Swift said in her Rolling Stone interview:
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to
You and I
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
It's time, oh-oh
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one-horse town,
I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
There's nothin' stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
And if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
But that's okay
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now, it's all too late, so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true
'Cause I know you
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Oh, oh

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, "Hey, by the way"

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said,
"Oh, my, my, my"
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Oh, yeah, oh
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say "hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
with Colbie Caillat
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around
with Colbie Caillat
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break,
no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
with Colbie Caillat
And I can't
breathe
without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
with Colbie Caillat
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
You're not sorry

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and
endearing
And I'm comfortable

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now, you're halfway out the door
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it
rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
"We should be together"
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is, "Come closer"
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

This version of the song captures the raw emotions behind the lyrics.
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin' to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Mr. "Perfect face," Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right, Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"
But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
Mr. "Never told me why,"
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology, so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day, forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shinin' bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy
I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good-girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Looking at it now
Last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

Been sittin' eyes wide open
Behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like it's no point hopin' at all
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I'm sittin' eyes wide open
And I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wonderin' if I dodged a bullet
Or just lost the love of my life, oh

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Future
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (
Woah, woah
I wanna be your end game, end game
Future
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (
Yeah
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (
Git, git
And I heard about you, ooh (
Yeah
You like the bad ones too
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me
I'm one call away whenever you need me
I'm in a G5 , come to the A-Side
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I’d be the man
They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh , let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kinda guy the ladies want
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it

It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they’re right
You were outnumbered this time
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter,
your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the
tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say,
"I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world , have you heard?
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you , but I miss sparklin'

Meet me at midnight
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel
The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one-night or a wife

I-I-I-I
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I’ve been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
I-I-I-I
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what wе do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voicе is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an
endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the
effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you
, but I touched you
And for a fortnight there,
we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask
Now you're in my backyard, turned
into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there,
we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

So  long , London
So  long , London
So  long , London
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe
Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?"
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from
the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"
And who's gonna hold you like me?
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie,
in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from
For a moment, I knew cosmic love
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
"Fuck it if I can't have him"
"I might just die, it would make no difference"
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?
Once the flight had flown
With the wilt of the rose
I slept all alone
You still wouldn't go
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?
Is it? Is it? Is it?
Whеn you lost control
Red blood, white snow
Blue dress on a boat
Your new girl is my clone

When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill
each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave
And then she wrotе headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you
And in the blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
I'm watchin'
American Pie
with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
But look at you
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me?
It's just a game, but really
I'm bettin' on all three  for us two
Get my car door, isn't that sweet?
Then pull mе to the back seat
No one's ever had me , not like you

Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her likе an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any measurе of a man

Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me "Downtown Lights"
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves
the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?
What if he's written
"mine"
on my
upper thigh
only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, "There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk"
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh

I took a page out of your favorite book
You sold me lies just by the way you look
Taught me a language that I'd never speak
Baby, that ain't for me, that, that ain't for me
I dug my grave watchin' the way you move
You took me higher than I ever flew, ooh
Too many times, gave you a second chance
Baby, I'm just a man, I'm, I'm just a man
No more thinkin' about you late night
No more runnin' around with your friends and I'm
Done pickin' the pieces of my
Soul up off the floor, oh, oh
I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willin'
But tonight, I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't wanna lose you, baby
But I can't play this gamе no more
I thought it would kill me
But tonight, I saved my lifе when I showed you the door

Sun is going down, time is running out
No one else around but me
Steady losing light, steady losing my mind
Moving shadows and grinding teeth
Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I'd do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you, I keep
Slipping into bad dreams
Where there's no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these
Bad dreams
Waitin' on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these, all of these
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bad dreams
Ooh, ooh, ooh
All of these

Are you even real
Or did I make you up?
How could someone like you
Wanna give me love?
Don't think I deserve you
But I can't get enough
You're so beautiful, spiritual
More like a miracle
Part of me's scared that you
Might be invisible
Too good to be true
Tell me
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Made up in my head, or are you in my bedroom?
Questions that I ask ever since I met you
Tеll me
Are you , arе you
Are you, are you
Somethin' from a dream or somethin' that I made up?
Questions that I ask every time that I wake up

No, woah
I woke up this morning kinda mad
Flipped a switch, I had the urge to beat your ass
Mm-mm
Turnin' up you in a different state
You fucked it up with me all kinds of ways, I'm mad
Boy, I'm so mad
You wanna tell me it was nothing
Why don't you tell me I'm a fool?
Say you're sorry 'bout it
I would be, too
I got no mercy
You don't deserve me, no
And you might be hurtin'
But damn it, you hurt me, boy
So I'll watch you suffer
Crawl back to me on broken glass
And you better love her
Regret will drive a person mad
I got no mercy
That shit was dirty
Dirty, dirty, dirty

Walking down the street last night
Watching strangers pass me by
Where do all our shadows go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know
I can fool my senses for a little while
But some things are too hard to reconcile
When I look into your eyes
There's no answers I can't find
It's a feeling that I've never known
And, when I'm wide awake tonight
Running circles in my mind
There's an answer I can't find
When did your heart let me go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know
I guess, somе things, I'll never know
I'm running out of avenuеs
'Cause every road leads back to you
When memories fade, where do they go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know

Of havin' only eyes for you
Of letting you turn my crimson skies blue, ooh
Of hatin' your somebody new
Of gettin' hella jealous of the ground that's under you, ooh
Of goin' way too hard
Or tryna call you while I'm stormin' out the bar
Of goin' way across the line
Of needin' you at the end of every night
I'm guilty, baby
I'm guilty, baby
If havin' a bleeding heart is a crime
If lovin' you means I'm servin' life
I'm guilty, baby
Of usin' medicine as a crutch
On the nights when the voices in my head won't shut up
Of goin' way (
Of goin' way
) too far (
Too far
Or drivin' by your place and countin' up the cars (
Up the cars
Of goin' way (
Of goin' way
) across the line (
Across the line
Of needin' you at the end of every night

God went crazy when He painted you
Ain't seen nothin' like this before, mm
Took a little extra time on you
Before He let you walk out the door
You got that smile, babe
You got that subtle Mona Lisa, drive me wild, babe
I'd give it all up just to keep you by my side, babe
I knew it from the jump
Fit right in my arms like you the one
Yeah, I'm made for you
I prayed for you
There's a light in your eyes every color in the sky
Don't come close to
Yеah, I'm made for you
I prayed for you
Swear that God wеnt crazy when He painted you
Ooh
Ooh

Got you cryin' on my shoulder
And I know better than to listen
Just because you're stayin' over
Doesn't mean that you're forgiven
We both know what you done, what you done
Don't love anyone, anyone
Anyone but yourself, oh
Just when I think I found the strength to go and push you away, away, oh
I pull you in again, oh, I'm such a sucker for the pain, pain, pain
Baby
I'm helpless, baby
Porcelain in your hands, bound to fall apart
You know how to break me
Hammer to the heart
Caption it passion, and then
Capture me, trap me instead
Happy to die in that web
Wrapped in the sheets of your bed
Ooh, know the only way I'm leaving
Ooh, is in pieces

Oh, oh
Walk this walk, you need no boots
I see myself each time I look at you
She's got it
) Everything that I need
She’s got it
) Always been so good to me
She's got it
) Now show me how you do it
She's got it
) First things first, it’s a real body
Born with it, she don't need no practice
Two first-class tickets just to fit that ass in
Been through it and she move right past it
That big body, big money, check your balance, yeah
She a ten plus three
Can't buy this honey and that shit ain't free
Look around you, ain't nobody average
She turn "can't have it" into a habit, yeah
Walk this walk, you need no boots
I see myself each time I look at you

My whole life I've been waiting for someone to fix this broken man
Every moment, a twist of a fate, but it made me who I am
I'd be lying if I told you that I knew
I had a life before there was you
But these small hands
They don't care where I come from, where I've been
Oh, I never loved myself, until the day I held
These small hands
Ooh, ooh, ooh
There was no getting ready, but I am glad I'm overwhelmed
The way you look back at me, it's like I finally see myself
In your mother's eyes, it's like they were made for you
But I can't lie, I got so much work to do
These small hands
They don't care where I come from, where I've been
Oh, I never loved myself, until the day I held
These small hands
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Girl, I guess you're doin' me a favor
Melt my armor down to chains and bolts
Love to you's a synonym of danger
Gas can light a flame with no remorse
Don't know why I let this go, go on for so long
Fake tears can never stain quite like the real ones
Pick a time you wasn't lying, bet you couldn't name me one
Name me one
If you can just leave me in the dead of the night
If you can deceive me looking dead in my eyes
You don't have to say it, baby, I understand
That I'm not your man, no, I'm not your man
This ain't how you trеat somebody you say you love
I gave you еverything, it still ain't enough
You don't have to say it, baby, I understand
That I'm not your man, no, I'm not your man
Once or twice ain't nothin' but a number
But don't say that you're sorry now
If I knew what it was, I would've been done, gave you up
There ain't no crawlin' back, I shut that down

Maybe it's the midnight air
Something 'bout the summer night
Maybe it's the stars up there
That made me say what's on my mind
I love the way you twist your hair
I'm seeing how you roll your eyes
I'm watching how your cheeks turn red
Must mean I'm doing something right
I ain't just blowing smoke
Girl, tonight, you look so beautiful
This must be a blessing, I just had to take a second
Step aside and catch my—
And let you know
Promise, girl, I ain't just blowing smoke
Let's go somewhere where we can be alone
Roll one up and burn it extra slow until the morning
Feeling like I had to come and let you know
Maybe you were Heaven-sent, yeah
Or maybe it's a waste of time
But I'm willing to take that bet
So, darling, will you roll the dice?
You already know you're a ten and it shows
Everyone hoping you walked in alone
So stop me if I say too much
'Cause I can never say enough

You lay your head
Gently on my shoulder
We made big plans
They changed as we got older
Oh, I know now what I didn't before
Sometimes, it's good to let a good thing go
But in my head, you're still mine
And I go back every night
I see your face in summer skies
I count the stars inside your eyes
Oh, what went wrong and what went right?
It fades away as years go by
We may not have a whole lifetime
But at least we had the Northern Lights
It hurts like hell
Admittin' I still miss you
Your heart in my hand
Somehow, I let it slip through, oh

I got eyes for the pain and darkness
She got smiles in a jar by the door
Senses when my sky is fallin'
My roof, my shelter from the storm
No, she don't mind all the times that my heart's been black and blue, mm
Sees the tears in my eyes from a different point of view
Well, she likes her days
Better when the sun go down
Yeah, she loves the rain
Well, maybe that means she can love me somehow
When the sky turns gray, you should see her face
She ain't even fazed by the clouds
She loves the rain
Well, maybe that means she can love me somehow
Keeps half a shell she found in Destin, mm
Right on top her bedroom drawer, mm
Next to a dozen dyin' flowers
She waits until the petals fall onto her floor

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever gettin' older

“Something Just Like This” is about a relationship that doesn’t need to be superhumanly perfect.
I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control and Batman with his fists
And clearly, I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, "Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?"
I'm not lookin' for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

We were stayin' in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair, but I thought,
"How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?"
If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were stayin' in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Postin' pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Gettin' drunk on the past we were livin' in

Daya asks her boyfriend to save her and prove that the good boys don’t hide away.
Crashin', hit a wall
Right now, I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reachin' out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around
I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losin' my mind now
It's in my head, darlin', I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
R-R-Runnin' out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side

Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Take it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher
Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew, hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room, hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Say you'll never let me go

I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations and sometimes they go wrong
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want and if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feelin' is like
And I say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-eah
And I say yeah, yeah-eah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-eah
Yeah, yeah-eah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-eah
I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions and stand by what you said
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Yeah, we're united under our indifference
And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

Playboi Carti
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine (
What?
Playboi Carti
Yeah, look, huh, nigga, this my shit
Welcome to the city of Gods (
What?
Pop was the king of New York, now I'm the nigga in charge
Only the drillers, the city is ours
We found out the opps and we pick 'em apart
I give 'em my time so I give 'em my heart
If the city love me, then I'm really a star (
What?
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
Nеw York City, please go easy on this hеart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me
Playboi Carti
Yeah, look, this is the city of money and violence
Everything we do is gon' come with a challenge
Every bitch you fuck is gon' come with a balance (
What?
Every shooter with me is coming in silence (
What?
And you niggas better pick a side
You niggas side hoppin'
If I want 'em to not let you come into the city, it's my option
This is the home of the fly shoppin'
This where the bitches gon' watch pockets
When I'm on TV, I gotta look good
'Cause I know the whole block watchin'
If you chill with the opps, we is not vibin'
If I see 'em in person, we Fox 5 'em
Yeah, the police is on us, we not stoppin'
This is the town of the big drip , smooth talk
Milly Rock , Shmoney Dance , Woo Walk
You will not survive being too soft
Been a long time, we took a new loss
Shooters shootin' 'til we got a new corpse
If we stop then we lettin' it cool off

You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I
Arrive, I count the seconds
Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this,
I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one
I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

When Jason was at the table
I kept on seeing him look at me when he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
Because, he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Did you see her?
She's so short, and that dress is so tacky
Who wears Cheetah?
It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing "Summertime Sadness"?
After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette? I really need one
But first, let me take a selfie
Let me take a selfie
Can you guys help me pick a filter?
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be? I want it to be clever
How about "Living with my bitches, #LIVE"?
I only got ten likes in the last five minutes
Do you think I should take it down?
Let me take another selfie

It's 4 AM, I don't know where to go
Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are taking me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows
That, ooh, the side effect to my loneliness is you
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
This happens every time I try to mix
Decision making with one too many drinks
But, ooh, if late-night friends have consequences, cool, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, I think about it all the time
Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

Yeah, let's do it again but, uh, this time, uh, let's go full psycho
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friend
She says she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it, yeah, the more I take offense
I'm so defeated, I can't get outside my head
I post a picture of myself 'cause I'm lonely
Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
I'm so defeated, I just want this shit to end
So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
Like everybody hates me
Like everybody hates me
I'm a product of the internet
And now, I'm face to face with all the voices in my head
I can't even check the time without facing regret
Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said?
And I'm not tryna be like, "Poor me," I made it
I'm just trying to stay normal now that they know what my name is
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
Yeah, they're the reason that I still am who I am

Yeah
Found cigarettes in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even smoke
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you no one knew
Yeah, you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flip it on me, say I think too much
You're movin' different when we makin' love
Baby, tell me, tell me
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy, where you been sleepin'?
This shit is keepin' me up at night, just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love?
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now?
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love?
I wanna know, I wanna know who

Two kids with their hearts on fire
Who's gonna save us now?
When we thought that we couldn't get higher
Things started looking down
I look at you and you look at me
Like nothing but strangers now
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Don't let it burn us out
Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you, yeah
Come on, let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah
You said, "Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said, "I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
So I call you mine
Can I call you mine?
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"

Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Where do you think you're going?
It's so late, late, late, what's wrong?
I said, "I can't stay, do I have to give a reason?"
It's just me, me, me, it's what I want
So how did we get here?
Three weeks now, we've been so caught up
Better if we do this on our own
Before I love you, na-na-na
I'm gonna leave you, na-na-na
Before I'm someone you leave behind
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine
Before I love you, na-na-na
I'm gonna leave you, na-na-na
Even if I'm not here to stay
I still want your heart

Whoa, oh
So far, so good
Mmm, oh, yep
Why?
You only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
Tell me that you're gonna change, then act like this instead
I'm too old to want somebody who's always switching up their friends
I can't make you love me, but at least you could pretend
Scrips gonna lead to fifths until I'm fucked out of my head
You play the same old songs
I know that you're different in your Air Force 1's
Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue
Like I got an addiction, yeah
You always say this shit's gonna change, but it never does

I go through your iPad looking for
Something that I used to have
Guess I finally lost my mind
I wish that I could take my number back
Go back to the place we met
Start this up a second time
You're living in a past life, twenty-five
All your friends are verified
Acting like they're first in line
I'm looking at your life through cellophane
Hoping things would stay the same
I was always by your side
And isn't it strange
How we're strangers again?
Isn't it strange
How we're strangers again?
And now we're strangеrs again
And now we're strangers again
You wеre just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen
Hurt me 'til I feel alive

Where will you go when it's over?
Who will you know when it's over?
I know, yeah, I saw you, you know that, right?
Just know that I saw you
Where will you go when it's over?
Do you get lost on your own?
I know, yeah, I saw you, you know that, right?
Just know that I saw you
Late night, zip ties
Make you wanna miss your flight
Flipping through your feelings like a Gemini
I'm staring at your dark side
So far, so gone
Standing with a white dress on
Only say you need me when your friends gone home
You're tryna get your mind right
But if I only get one life, this is what I wanna do
And if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
And if I only have one night, yeah, I'd spend it with you
So if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
I’m gonna live it with you

I feel jet-lagged everyday
I've been out my mind, drinking anyway
Do you have the time? Tell me what's the date
Might be out of line but I feel in place
I thought I heard you say
Up and down in the crowd
Finally, I feel better now
Off the ground, in the clouds
Wish that you could see me now
I don't doubt, say it loud
Came up from the underground
Turned around, made it out
I wish that you could see me now
I wish that you could see me now
Wish that you could see me now
I wish that you could see me now
I wish that you could see me now
Wish that you could see me now
I wish that you could see me now
Up and down in the crowd
Finally, I feel better now
Off the ground, in the clouds
Wish that you could see me now
I don't doubt, say it loud
Came up from the undеrground
Turned around, made it out
I wish that you could see me now
Up and down in thе crowd
Finally, I feel better now
Off the ground, in the clouds
Wish that you could see me now
I don't doubt, say it loud
Came up from the underground
Turned around, made it out
I wish that you could see me now

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

I don't really say this that often
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me
Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losin', but I'm losin' my mind
Does anybody know what that's like?
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody
You should've known better
Than to listen to your heart again
People change with the weather
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else
You put it back together
Don't let it fall apart again
People change with the weather
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody

I would have walked through fire to kiss your lips
Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been
Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why
You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope
Hope
Hope
Hope
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

Young
We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can grow from this, yeah
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can grow from this, yeah
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

The other one is, of course, outing yourself
I think be the first to out yourself, I always think
Because, you know, there's no end to the hypocrisy of the human heart
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
It's 5 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you
But I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though
I'm just on the radio
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

Seneler sürer her günüm
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Seneler sürer her günüm
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around, bring your friend with you
But we ain't really gonna sleep at all
You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures
In my city, I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous
She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby, I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin'
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private
, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like

I'ma care for you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you
You make it look like it's magic
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
And I'm so used to bein' used
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah
Girl, you earned it, yeah
You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful
And stay forever young
This I know, uh
This I know
She told me, "Don't worry
About it"
She told me, "Don't worry
No more"
We both know we can't go
Without it
She told me, "You'll never
Be alo-oh-oh-ooh"
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh

Ayy
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait?
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name?
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro
Ayy
Young Metro, young Metro
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now
I'm talkin'
Time
Rolling Stone
, and
Bazaar
now (
Bazaar
now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

Yeah
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty
No one's around to judge me
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

Thought I almost died in my dream again
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep
Without you, I can't sleep
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Ooh, yeah
I just pretend that I'm in the dark and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you

Ooh
Na-na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I saw the fire in your eyes
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes
You tell me things you wanna try
I know temptation is the devil in disguise
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice
You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light
It's like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says
Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to—

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfеct
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we'rе goin' through it (
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you (
Ooh, ooh

Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me

Trade my whole life just to be
Tell nobody I control you

They can't tell but I love you
'Cause you're loyal, baby
I love when you're submissive
You love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'

Traffic dies while we are racin' home
Melted lights cover the open road
I hope we make it 'cause I've been chasin'
Another odyssey, oh
I can't wait to see your face
Crash when we're switchin' lanes
My love's beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake
We're dancin' in the flames
It's indescribable
Ooh, yeah
"The world can't heal," they say on the radio
So grab the wheel, want you to be in control
We're dodgin' headlights, and you say, "Hold tight"
Another odyssey, oh

I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how—
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me

Yo, yo

'Cause all y'all other—
Out there doing what I'm doing
Or tryna do what I'm doing

What about you?
Huh? Huh? Come on
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, "Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly?"
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it—
My way
My way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way
My way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

What you doing? Really?
You know I'm coming over, right?
Now, you got it hot for me already, baby?
Okay
Uh, give me ten minutes
Be ready
Hey, wear that little thing I like, yeah
It's seven o'clock on the dot

I pull up, anticipating
Good love, don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I never seen, girl, you know what I mean
Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt, ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow
See, I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be making love until the sun comes up, baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow

Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got somethin' to tell you
Listen
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See, this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you
But you remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
Thought that she was the one for me
'Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexin' everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

Second single off of 8701, a Billboard Hot 100 chart topping R&B ballad.
Ooh-oh

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone , hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh
Come on, that's how it's going down
You smell it? Hah, yeah
You smell it? Hah, yeah
Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh
Situations will arise
In our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
I loved you, you were my girl
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leaving, baby
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight

Up in the club with my homies
Tryna get a little V-I, keep it down on the low-key
'Cause you know how it is (
Hey, hey
I saw this shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear, you would think that she know me
I decided to chill (
Okay
Conversation got heavy (
Hey
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
Watch out!
Watch out!
She was sayin', "Come get me"
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, "Baby, let's go" (
Let's go
When I told her, I said

Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time comin', but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn , let it burn , gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn , let it burn , gotta let it burn

Watch this

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home,
you're like a dream come true
But, if by chance, you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie, you sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together at Skyfall
At Skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Just the guitar, okay, cool
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me, mmm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me, mmm
That was what you told me
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I built a house for a love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears
But, oh my
Oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Tryna learn to lean into it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right

When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holdin' me the way you do
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?
It's so cold out here
In your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never-endin', we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please, stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all, the more that we will fight

How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied
You better believe I'm tryin'
To keep climbin'
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm findin' it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely
Angelo Adkins
Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent
I don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save mе
Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel likе that?
Do you like me?
You know mummy doesn't like anyone else like I like you, right?
I'm holdin' on
Mama's got a lot to learn
I'm holdin' on
Mama's got a lot to learn

Hold on
You are still strong
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on
Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off
It's hard to hold on to who I am
When I'm stumblin' in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling with myself, with no chance to win
Let time be patient
Let pain be gracious
Just hold, hold on
I swear to God, I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress
I'm my own worst enemy
Right now, I truly hate bein' me
Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?

I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me comin' back even though I'm terrified
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Under haunted skies, I see you, ooh
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

Pink, it's my new obsession, yeah
Pink, it's not even a question
Pink on the lips of your lover
'Cause pink is the love you discover
Pink, as the bing on your cherry
Pink, 'cause you are so very
Pink, it's the color of passion
'Cause today it just goes with the fashion
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light
And pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight
You could be my flamingo
'Cause pink is the new kinda lingo
Pink, like a deco umbrella
Yeah, it's kink, but you don't ever tell her, yeah
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light
Yeah, pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight

I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and
I hit the floor
Yeah, I
thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
That one last shot's a
permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

Hey, j-j-jaded
You got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be?
You're getting it all over me, ex-rated
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I been thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you
Hey, j-j-jaded
In all its misery
It will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side
We're thinking of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm so jaded
And baby, I'm afraid of you

I'm dreaming tonight, I'm living back home
Right
Yeah, yeah
Take me back to a south Tallahassee
Down 'cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Can't stand up on my feet in the city
Got to get back to the real nitty-gritty
Yes, sir, no, sir
Don't come close to my
Home sweet home
Can't catch no dose
Of my hot tail poontang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J. Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer
Home sweet home
Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma, she's a-cooking
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto

There's something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't His
It sure ain't no surprise, yeah
We're livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
There's something wrong with the world today
The light bulb's getting dim
There's meltdown in the sky
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister, you're a better man than I
We're livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge
Livin' on the edge

Aerosmith scored their first top 20 single in ten years with “Dude ”, the first single from Permanent Vacation. But its third single, “Angel”, outdid all of their previous hits.
I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
And the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
Don't know what I'm gonna do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride, yeah, yeah
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone

I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
Riding into town alone
By the light of the moon
I'm looking for old Sukie Jones
She crazy horse saloon
Barkeep give me a drink
That's when she caught my eye
She turned to give me a wink
That'd make a grown man cry
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
Come easy, go easy
All right until the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight
I'm like a loaded gun
Peeling off my boots and chaps
I'm saddle sore
Four bits gets you time in the racks
I scream for more
Fool's gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back

Ooooh, yeah
There goes my old girlfriend
There's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises?
I guess they don't mean a thing
So, baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back
I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

It ain't easy livin' like a gypsy
Tell you, honey, how I feel
I been dreamin', floatin' down stream, and
Losin' touch with all that's real
Whole earth lover, keepin' undercover
Never knowin' where you've been
You've been fadin', always out paradin'
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Well, you've always got your tail on the wag
Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon
It ain't easy living like you wanna
And it's so hard to find peace of mind, yes, it is
The way I see it, you got to say shit
But don't forget to drop me a line

“Big Ten-Inch Record” is a cover of ‘dirty blues’ sax man Bull Moose Jackson’s 1952 song. It was written as a double entendre about ten-inch vinyl records that were common in the early 1900s.
Got me the strangest woman
Believe me this trick's no cinch
But I really get her going
When I whip out my big ten inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues
Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
She said now stop that jivin'
Now whip out your big ten inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues
I, I, I cover her with kisses
And when we're in a lover's clinch
She gets all excited
When she begs for my big ten inch

Every time​ that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face gettin' clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win
Half my life's in books' written pages
Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'
While you're far away and dreamin'
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Lyin' close to you, feelin' your heart beatin'
And I'm wonderin' what you're dreamin'
Wonderin' if it's me you're seein'
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever
Forever and ever

Backstroke lover
Always hidin' 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to your daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothin'
'Til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways"
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I know love was here to stay
When she told me to

There was a time
When I was so broken-hearted
Luck wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
So listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me, yeah!
Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

Oh, good morning Mr. Tyler, going down?
Hehehehehe, ooh
Yeah!
Workin' like a dog for the boss man
Workin' for the company
Bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'
I'm gonna have a fantasy
But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
To read between the lines
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Shaggin' in the elevator
Lingerie second floor
She said, "Can I see you later"
"And love you just a little more?"
I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out alive
She said, "I'll show you how to fax in the mail room, honey
And have you home by five"

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing out things that nobody wears
You're calling my name, but I got to make clear
I can't say, baby, where I'll be in a year
Some sweathog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go musta got up and went
Well, I got good news, she's a real good liar
‘Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
That, that
That, that
Backstage, we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
"Forgive me if I seem out of line"
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways, you hear me?
Say you're leavin' on a 7:30 train
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood
Girl, you've been givin' me that line so many times
It kinda gets like feelin' bad looks good, yeah
That kinda loving turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving sends a man right to his grave
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue

Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound of my gun
Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?
They said when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But, man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her
dog day
's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and
the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain

Rag doll,
living in a movie
Hot tramp,
daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see you
Leaving by the back door, man
Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby, won't you do me
Like you done before?
I'm feeling like a bad boy
Mmm, just a like a bad boy
I'm ripping up a rag doll
Like throwing away an old toy
Some babe's talking real loud
Try and sell me on an old dream
A new version of the old scene
Speakeasy on the grapevine
Keep shuffling in a shoe shine
Old Tin Lizzy
, do it 'til you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery
Rag doll, living in a movie
Hot tramp, daddy's little cutie
You're so fine, they'll never see you
Leaving by the back door, man
Hot time, get it while it's easy
Don't mind, come on up and see me
Rag doll, baby, won't you do me
Like you done before?

You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
You crossed the line and it's time to say "F you"
What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
Noah Cyrus
Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try
staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope
, but I still
can't let you go

We're not in love
We share no stories
Just somethin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side
Fall into the dark side
Give in to the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side

I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment before I go, it's nothing personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand
So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
Blep, yah, yah
Farru
Yah-yah-yah-yah

Hello, sweet grief
I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the mornin' after ecstasy
I am drownin' in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doin' everything I can
To make sure I never love again
I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

We were young, posters on the wall
Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
We would stare at each other
'Cause we were always in trouble
And all the cool kids did their own thing
I was on the outside always looking in
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
They never really cared if I wasn't
We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
Then I saw your face, your forgiving eyes
Looking back at me from the other side
Like you understood me
And I'm never letting you go, oh

Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away

Woah
Eyes up, you've been gone for a fortnight
My love, are you stuck in a fake life?
Can't win, if the prize is to waste your time
Now it's wasting mine
And I know that we're close, but I'm lonely
Make me your only, won't win a trophy
But can it kiss you like this when you hold me?
Missing it lowkey, I'll say it slowly
It's me or the PS5
Tell me how you wanna spend your night
Three's feeling way too tight
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
Me or the PS5
Tell me which of us is more your type
Seems like you can't decide
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
Oh-oh

I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Cold hands, red eyes
Packed two bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines
I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Wait a second, let me catch my breath
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice
Anywhere, anytime
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep
Remember me now, time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby

Hello, hello, can you hear me as I scream your name?
Hello, hello, do you need me before I fade away?
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie
Hello, hello, nice to meet you, voice inside my head
Hello, hello, I believe you, how can I forget?
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark, I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie
We live, we love, we lie

In the dark of night
The stars light up the sky
We see them flying free
That's just like you and me
Everyone is lonely sometimes
But I would walk a thousand miles to see your eyes
You are not alone, we are family
Hold me, let's escape all this reality
You are my symphony
By your side, we are unity
You are my energy
My guiding light, we are unity
We are unity
We are unity
Although the rain might pour
A thunder starts to roar
The lightnin' wakes the wave
But through it, we are brave

Mm, yeah
Mirrors, they never lie
Don't see myself inside
Why can't I get it right?
I don't know
You're always watching me fall
Shadows, they like my wall
Why do I feel so small?
I don't know
So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know
I lost, I lost, I lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame, I lost control again
I don't, I don't, I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame, I lost control again
Ooh

“Different World” is a promo and final single by EDM producer Alan Walker from his debut album Different World.
All we know
Left untold
Beaten by a broken dream
Nothing like what it used to be
We've been chasing our demons down an empty road
Been watching our castle turning into dust
Escaping our shadows just to end up here
Once more
And we both know
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
Broken smile, tired eyes
I can feel your longing heart
Call my name, howling from afar

Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then, she tried to run
And then on a night with the settin' sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone
They've warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hidin' in the dark
Then somethin' came creepin'
It told her, "Don't you worry, just
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh"
Just let me in, ooh

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
Y-y-y-you think you're so small like you're itty-bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walkin' by strangers on the side of the street
Like a quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of m-m-m-mind, like
Like it's just a waste of time, like-like-like
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world

Hey
I know what I came to do
And that ain't gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
'Cause I won't take the bait
I'm over here doin' what I like
I'm over here workin' day and night
And if my real ain't real enough
I'm sorry for you, babe
Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holdin' us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me (
Focus
), f-f-focus on me, woo (
Focus on me
Focus on me (
Focus
), f-f-focus on me, woo (
Focus on me
I can tell you're curious
It's written on your lips
Ain't no need to hold it back
Go 'head and talk your shit
I know you're hopin' that I'll react
I know you're hopin' I'm lookin' back
But if my real ain't real enough
Then I don't know what is

Oh, yeah
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'—

You got me some type of way
Ain't used to feelin' this way
I do not know what to say
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face
Now I wanna know how you taste
Usually don't give it away
But you know I'm already thinkin' 'bout it
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"
Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin'
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right, but I don't care
Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
This shit always happen to me
Why can't we just play for keeps?
Practically on my knees
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you already thinkin' 'bout it

Mmm
Hey, yeah
I'm stuck with you
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby

I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothin' at all
It's comin' down on me
Water like misery
It's comin' down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain on me
Mm, oh yeah, baby
Rain on me
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try, mm
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah

Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hopin’ I don't repeat history
Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday
Never need no , no one else, babe
’Cause I'll be
Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do
That I won't do, switchin’ for you
Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true
But I get tired of runnin', fuck it
Now, I’m runnin' with you
Said, boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday
Never need no , no onе else, babe
'Causе I'll be

In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on
Come on and walk this way through the fire
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like
"Yes, and?"
Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "What's next?"
"Yes, and?"
Now, I'm so done with caring
What you think, no, I won't hide
Underneath your own projections
Or change my most authentic life

You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman
I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it
And I can be all the things you told me not to be
When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
And he see the universe when I'm the company
It's all in me

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side
I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I—
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side

Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin' , I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up , pickin' it up
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but, boy, I like it
I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We out here vibin'
We vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now
Can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah

Hmm
You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been cravin'
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies
So what you doin' tonight?
Better say, "Doin' you right"
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight
I don't wanna keep you up
But show me, can you keep it up?
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy
I've been drinkin' coffee
And I've been eatin' healthy
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah
Savin' up my energy
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five
Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm
Sometimes, it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better 'cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothin' here without you
So, one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should've been more careful

Step up, the two of us, nobody knows us
Get in the car like, "Skrrt"
Staying up all night, order me pad thai
Then we gon' sleep 'til noon
Me with no makeup, you in the bathtub
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never
Act this regular
Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world
Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, "Ooh"
Feels like forever, baby, I never
Thought that it would be you
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit
That's how I know it's true
Baby, direct it, name in the credits
Like the movies do

It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothin' from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
I wanna love me
The way that you love me
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me
The way that you trust me
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared
Learnin' to be grateful for myself
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine

I'm a motherfuckin' train wreck
I don't wanna be too much
But I don't wanna miss your touch
And you don't seem to give a fuck
I don't wanna keep you waiting
But I do just what I have to do
And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't allowed to have no boo
'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten, it's crazy
I can't have what I want, but neither can you
You ain't my boyfriend
And I ain't your girlfriend
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend
And I ain't your girlfriend
But you don't want me to touch nobody else
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody
Even though you ain't mine, I promise the way we fight
Make me honestly feel like we just in love
'Cause, baby, when push comes to shove
Damn, baby, I'm a train wreck, too
I lose my mind when it comes to you
I take time with the ones I choose
And I don't want a smile if it ain't from you, yeah

If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish
But after all this damage, I can’t help it
But what you can trust is I need your touch

I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him
We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah

You know, you have to be free in this world
You have to glow, you gotta drip, you gotta, like, express yourself, you know?
But you can't do that when you give everybody your power
They'll do whatever they want with you
You know, you can't do that
Ernähr' mich von Glyphosat und UVA
Lass' mich berieseln von dem Größenwahn
Was nicht schön ist, wird schön gesagt
Pflanze auf Beton, ich komm' im Garten an
Ich versicher' meine Artefakte
Bin gespannt, welches der viralen TikToks später im Museum landet
Bleibt die Seele odеr nur die Maske?
Ist es Kunst und ist еs das dann nur, wenn es als Kunst verpackt ist?
Stell mir 'ne Selbstdiagnose: ADHS
Gib mir alles, aber nimm mir nicht das Handy weg
Wie viele Talkshows muss ich schau'n, bis ich die Welt verstanden hab'?
Das lyrische Ich frisst sich am liebsten an Dystopien satt
Gib mir das Mic gib mir den Raum, gib mir die Aufmerksamkeit
Gib mir das High, gib mir das Low, ich hab' nicht mehr viel Zeit
Gib mir den Schlüssel aus der Matrix, ich will alles draußen seh'n
Alles, damit ich die Zeit nach mir überleb'

If you're lookin' for perfect, well, I ain't
Sometimes a sinner more than saint
Seems like I spend most my time
In the gray between the black and white
Fly with angels, run with demons
Some days I'm just breakin' even
Just 'cause I'm not the Sunday mornin' crowd
Don't mean that I'm more lost than found
And, oh-oh-oh
It might sound a little crazy
But, oh-oh-oh
God talks to me
I heard Him in momma's prayers back when I didn't care
He was tellin' me He was right there
And He spoke through the sound of the crash with that metal and glass
Sayin', "Son, you're goin' way too fast"
You might not believe
But God talks to me
Yeah, God talks to me

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

Yeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
Am I your
fire?
Your one
desire
Yes, I know it's
too late
But I want it that way

Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright!
Hey-yeah, oh
Oh my God, we're back again
Brothers, sisters, everybody sing
Gonna bring the flavor, show you how
Got a question for you, better answer now, yeah
Brian
Am I original?
Yeah
Am I the only one?
Yeah
Am I sexual?
Yeah
Am I everything you need?
You better rock your body now
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body, yeah
Everybody, yeah
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back, alright!
Alright!

As long as you love me
with Brian
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Riskin' it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
Where you're from, what you did
As long as you love me
Who you are, where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
with Kevin
Nick
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

Baby, oh-oh
Even in my heart, I see
You're not being true to me
Deep within my soul, I feel
Nothing's like it used to be
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart
Before you tear us apart
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop
You're tearing us apart
Quit playing games with my heart
I live my life the way
To keep you coming back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see

I got mixed emotions
Did I finally find me a river
That could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love
That leaves you battered and broken
So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got
Am I being too open?
'Cause I told you everything I have to say
And now we're having a moment
Does it make you wanna pack up all your things
And drive away like you stole it?
Just forgive me if I'm being too open
No no no no, yeah yeah yeah

Hmm, mmmh, yeah, yeah
with Howie
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every
minute it makes me weaker
You can
save me from the man
That I've become, oh yeah
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
with Kevin
Howie
Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is trying to call you
help me
I can't wait there's more, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If I was
thinkin' it makes me weaker
You can
save me
from the man
I've become
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's somethin' missin' in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Brian
I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car to get to you
I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
But my love is all
I have to give
Without you I don't
think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
When you talk
Does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave
When you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

“Chances” is a love song describing a serendipitous encounter between a boy and a girl that blossoms into a loving relationship. The boy is expressing his gratitude at being so lucky.
What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
Getting close to you, but here we are

Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Woo
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent
In flashes of light
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Brian
Lookin' at the crowd
And I see your body sway, come on
Wishin' I could thank you
In a different way, come on

“Incomplete” is the power ballad that put the Backstreet Boys back on the map in the mid-2000’s.
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you, within me, I can't find no rest
Where I'm going, is anybody's guess
with Howie
I tried
to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake,
but my world is half asleep
I pray
for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is
Incomplete
with Howie
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming
in an ocean all alone
Baby,
my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake
I tried
to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake
, but my world is half asleep
I pray
for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is
Incomplete

Oh-oh yeah
Don't pretend you're sorry
I know you're not
You know you got the power
To make me weak inside
And girl you leave me breathless
But it's okay
'Cause you are my survival
Now hear me say
I can't imagine
Life without your love
And even forever
Don't seem like long enough
Brian
'Cause every time I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep drowning in your love

"Hello"
"Hi, it's me. Wassup baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So, don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"W-Wait? Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out. I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me, we're going to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!"
with All
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
When there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No,
someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Howie
I've been to Paris, made my way down to Rome
Seen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico
But I could care less, 'cause I was all alone
And there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
You're my daybreak, you're my California sun
You're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one
In the city, the country, the mountains or sea
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you, no

Yeah
I'm yours completely
I feel so deeply
You're my first thought every day
And I want it that way
My life is for you
And I adore you
I love you more every day
And I want it that way
No goodbyes
Ain't nothing but a heartache
No more lies
Ain't nothing but a mistake
That is why
I love it when I hear you say
I want it that way
My heart is on fire
Such a strong desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Chance the Rapper
You are my fire (
Flamin' hot nachos?
The one desire (
They made the original hot-hot-hot?
Believe when I say
I want it that-that-that way
Backstreet Boys
Ooh, hot stuff all over my nachos
Walkin' like a taco, drivin' over potholes (
Tell me why
Hotter than a pot roast, fingers on my hot chips
Red-handed, c'mon, man, now I'ma need some chopsticks (
Tell me why
Before I leave the house, man, I'ma need another outfit
Flyer than a maggot on a wall inside a cockpit
Speaking of desire, man, you preachin' to the choir, man
My tongue is doin' fine, but the roof is on fire
Backstreet Boys
, &
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
The original, now it's hot

Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Ooh
Do-do-do-do-do
Sand keeps slipping right through my hands
Days all feel the same, still numb from you
First step off of this plane, I knew
I suffocate without you, heart beats for two
It was good
What we had
If it was paradise
Can somebody take me back?
And it hurts
Looking back
If this is for the best
Then tell me why it hurts so bad
Don't let go when the daylight's gone
'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn
I breathe, oh
When the cold air starts filling up my lungs
When I hate the things that I've become
I breathe, oh

You fill me up 'til you're empty
I took too much and you let me
We've been down all these roads before
And what we found don't live there anymore
It's dark, it's cold
If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold
Maybe you'd be happier with someone else
Maybe loving me's the reason you can't love yourself
Before I turn your heart into a ghost town
Show me everything we built so I can tear it all down
Down, down, down, down
You know I'll stay, don't you tempt mе
But all this weight is getting heavy
Been holding up what wasn't mеant to stand
I turned this love into a wasteland
It's dark, it's cold
If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold

Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces
Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got
Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you
Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got
Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

There's nothing colder than your shoulder
When you're dragging me along like you do, like you do
And then you switch up with no warnin'
And you kiss me like you want it, how rude, how rude
But I kinda like it anyways
I don't mind if this is gonna take a million days
I know you'll come around to me eventually
If you sit back, relax, and join my company, my company
Once you know what my love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right, you can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream, taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies, 'cause it feels so
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know
My love is so mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know
My little hard-to-get baby
I wanna give you the world
Not saying you gotta chase me
But I wouldn't mind it
If you gave me just a little bit
Of something we can work it with
But all you do is push me out

I'd never met you, but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're
In your head right now
While your world is spinning out
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me slow it down

Oh, I remember how you were
You were every shade of perfect
And then the colors blurred
And you'll never love me like you did
You'll never love, you'll never love me like you did
And I see your ghost from time to time
When I'm driving through the Rockies
And I feel this little knife in my heart
And it bleeds me out
Don't wanna love, I don't wanna love you now
Oh, how come all the best things fall apart?
And it startеd pretty slowly
Oh, when you asked about thе old me
"Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone?" Oh, I don't know
I think I left him somewhere I no longer go
And I watch you run away now
From all the lovely things we hate now
Where did we go? Where did we go? Oh, I don't know
But I know it feels like somewhere far away from home
And it's falling into pieces
No, there's not a way that we can stop this now
One thousand miles an hour, we're driving off the edge
And, darling, now there's nothing left
And it started out so slowly

Momma, I'm missing home
And California's getting colder
And colder, and colder
I miss you
And, Momma, I'm getting old
Does that mean you're getting older
And older, and older?
I miss you
Momma, don't you know
There's nothing to be sorry about?
I'm so proud of all you've done
Take me down your old street
Tell me your memories of when you were young and when you fell in love
Drive me through the country
Tell me your story and you can play all of your favorite songs
'Cause I'm gonna need this
When I'm holding pictures of you and that's all that I've got left
All that I've got left
All that I've got left
Lately, it's getting hard
I've started looking like my father
And it makes me cry a little bit
'Cause he really should've made it big
'Cause, damn, he's good at everything
And everything I am's because of you
I'm a man because of you

I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
But it's good to see your face
And I really hope you're doin' well
I hope you're doin' well
She was runnin' late for dinner, South side of town
Left the phone a little bitter, but it's cool for now
Far from perfect for each other, but we're workin' it out, I suppose
Now I'm waiting at the diner, looking traumatized
'Cause you walk up to the table with an order of fries
And I know ya, yes, I know ya, used to love you
And I said
I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
It's good to see your face
And I really hope you're doin' well
I hope you're doin' well
I'm sorry, I'm here for someone else
I wish that I could stay
And talk at the bar all by ourselves
But I'm here for someone else

I tried to hide it through the silence while I played along
I'm welling up behind my eyelids when I'm holding on
To the rage, so badly I hate him
And I wish that all of—
Nah, nah, nah, that doesn't feel right
Maybe, uh, speed it up
Yeah, that's nice
I really hate the way you think that you can get away
By blaming all your stupid problems on your mental state
I'm tired of burnt-out lies, oh
Ooh
You think you know me, but you hardly even know yourself
I'd bite my tongue and let you think I only wish you well
I don't, I know you know it
Ooh
And I'm tired of letting someone get the bеst of me, so go ahead and
Cry, cry
Go ahead and ruin somеone else's life
Cry, cry
Go bug somebody else, so I can sleep at night

He was a stranger
He walked in looking for danger
When he stares at you
He can chain you down and make you fall in love
Heaven knows, yeah
They made him out of fire and roses
With an attitude
But he's sweet enough to put him on your tongue
He can be everything you've ever dreamed
Ooh, Mr. Electric Blue
I wanna dance like you
How did you get so cool?
And, oh, you got electric soul
You lеt the good times roll
Mr. Electric Bluе
They say that he fell from space
Or some supernatural place
Mr. Electric Blue
I know I believe in you

Why would I want to fly
Be on the last red eye
Talkin' to your voice, only hearing noise
Oh, it's not enough
All of the nights I spent
Drownin' my discontent
Wasting me away, everything has changed
Now that I found us
And it feels like home
Darling, if you don't mind
I'll take your hand tonight
We could just slow down time
Let me adore you
And from the moment I looked in those dark brown eyes
I can't remember life
Before you
Why would I want to go?
Now that you're all I know
Smilin' under stars
Playin' chasin' cars
Somethin' 'bout the art of music in the dark

You're the lump in my throat
You're the reason I choke
On the words that I wish I had said
You're the feeling of home
Smell of smoke on my coat
Miss you over, and over again
Everybody says I'll survive, I'll be fine
But they don't know what it's like
If it doesn't wake you up
In a violent sweat and steal your breath
If it doesn't make a cut
That just won't close, it wasn't love
So let me go
Did you learn how to drive?
Are you somewhere tonight
With someone tryna paint over me?
Oh, it hurts but it should
It hurts but it's good
'Causе the best kinda love scars' deep

I remember we were only sixteen at the time
We stole your daddy's car the day you learned to drive
You nearly killed us both a half mile down the road
Yeah, we were upside down and moving in slow motion
We're just floating
So wild and free
And it all made sense to me
If I'm gonna die a young American
And this was the final night we'd ever have again
I'd be just fine as long as I'm wherever you are
'Causе you stole my young, American heart
Wеll, it's been a long two years since you have left the country
And now, you and I, we're living in some crazy times
And I get so scared we'll never make it through our twenties
And we'll lose it all for nothing, nothing
If I'm gonna die a young American
And this was the final night we'd ever have again
I'd be just fine as long as I'm wherever you are
'Cause you stole my young, American heart

Ooh, la, la, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la
When you pull me in and you hold me close
And you say all kinds of crazy things that make me wanna stay in your arms
You're a charm, I'm in love
But you don't care when I'm falling down, slowly burning out
And the lights, and crowds, and cameras in my face are getting louder
And I need some time
You say, "Why?"
Don't you see that
Lately (
I've been tryna—
), I've been fading? (
I've been tryna—
I can't breathe inside this cage
You took the man in me
You took his sanity
You stole the last of any light inside his eyes
You really made me bleed
Blood on these ivory keys
You killed the only part of me I еver liked

I started driving through the hills, told me to come and get you
No words convey the way it felt for me to finally hold you
In my arms just long enough to know
Know every word you're gonna say before you even think it
But, somehow, every joke you make is funnier each time around
Your laugh is such a perfect sound
These butterflies lived a million lives to say
I swear I've known you longer than
Forever and a day
A day
Forever and ever and a day
A day
Forеver and a day
I bet we alrеady knew our names before we met each other
I bet we've sailed the Milky Way, walked on the Sun together
How could I forget those emerald eyes?
They took me by surprise, but suddenly
I missed your face, I knew that smile from miles away
I knew that I have loved you

Bi-di-bum-bum-bum
Do-do, do, do-do
Ba-da-ba-da-bum
I took a trip to Italy
I'm looking for a little peace
And there you go, right down the road
So beautiful
Flowers in your braided hair
Calvin Klein underwear
Hanging out your jeans, you're such a tease
So beautiful
I just need your number
So if you're alone
I wanna be the one you call
When you need anything, anything at all
I wanna be the name you scream
When you need anything

Benson Boone revisits a bygone relationship in his  soul rock anthem “Reminds Me Of You.”
You got a million different pairs of underwear
Spread out on my couch 'cause you left 'em there
You got a couple little candles in my living room
I still light at night just to set the mood
A box of written letters on my nightstand
With a Polaroid picture of your chest
And when I'm driving my car to the overlook spot
I can smell your perfume in the vents
And, ooh, what do I do?
What do I do?
When every damn thing reminds me of you
Reminds me of you
When every damn thing reminds me of you
Reminds me of you
Whеn every damn thing reminds mе of—
Flip phones, Listerine
Tired eyes and drinking coffee
I see you everywhere the wind blows
Our handprints settled in on the windows
Cars, trains, T-shirt stains
Even places I ain't ever been
No, I ain't ever been

Didn't know how much I would love Santa Barbara
Never driven up, but I know that it's gotta be so beautiful
If that's where you were born
Long brown hair that your mom doesn't like
You got a moon tattoo that you don't even hide
You're so unusual
Haven't met someone like you before
Wanna be that guy that's makin' it hard for you to sleep at night
I want you to call me when it's gettin' late
You could tell me anything
From time to time, you give me the smallest look
Behind your eyes, and, baby, it's almost like you need someone
I promise I can be someone
From night to night, it's takin' you longer
When you say, "Goodbye," and, baby, it's almost like you need someone
I promise I can be someone
I've been carried away tryin' to get inside your brain
And what do you know? Do you live alone?
And do you pray?
And do you believe there is a life
Where it's just you and me and I?
We don't need a way, we don't need a sign
It's only you and me and I

Brand-new apartment, we sat on the floor
A blow-up mattress and some plastic forks
Our clothes on the counter, keys in the door
You're all that I wanted, never been so sure
Chances are
The future will take us places that we can't imagine yet
And chances are
Yours is the face I could never forget
But suddenly nothing is the way that it was
Is this what it feels like to love someone?
Don't know what you had until it's gone
Is this what it feels like to love someonе?
Love someone, lovе someone
Empty apartment, I'm sat on the floor
A blow-up mattress and a plastic fork
Fighting the flashbacks that creep through the door
I stare at the ceiling and I try to ignore
Chances are
We're gonna tell ourselves this is how it's supposed to be
And chances are
This isn't the last time I'll dance with your memory

Wait for me right down Old Owen Road
It's been a while, these streets are overgrown
I'm glad to see your eyes ain't changed at all
They always looked a little greener in the fall
Kiss me, kiss me slowly
Like you did when we were young
And hold me like you know me
Like the old days, walk me home
Let's go on a walk, how have you been?
Did that fancy college art school let you in?
Well, damnit, they'd be crazy if they never saw in you
What I failed to see at seventeen, I must've missed it too
Oh, kiss me, kiss me slowly
Like you did when we were young
And hold me like you know me
Like the old days, take me home

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
, mm-mm

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on
Survivor
just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

Oh, mm-mm
I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh
"Call me when you're there"
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'"
So now, she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair
Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change , you could borrow
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby
Birds of a feather, we should stick together
, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
I said you
You were the love of my life
The love of my life
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you
Then you tried to break mine
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me
Then you moved on immediately
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
When I said you
You  were the love of my life
The love of my life

Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

Khalid
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (
Found
But you never go away (
Never go away
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
with Khalid
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
with Billie Eilish
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
Hmm
Well, good things don't last
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
f "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

Billie
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Mehki Raine
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes
But now she's got to get to class
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say
Aww
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away
Hahahahahahahaha
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys"
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
Yay
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

“my future” portrays Billie reflecting on her past and her future, and her change in style from a more melancholic sound, towards a happier, more optimistic one.
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I , I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
I know supposedly I'm lonely now
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone
But aren't I someone?
I'd  like to be your answer
'Cause you're so handsome

My Lucifer is lonely
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely

Mind
Mind
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom again?
Retrace my lips, erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair

Too much to bear

Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?

Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
, mm-mm

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on
Survivor
just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive
I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I
In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night
And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

Oh, mm-mm
I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one
And I could never get enough
I could buy her so much stuff
It's a craving, not a crush, huh
"Call me when you're there"
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
And I left it under 'Claire'"
So now, she's comin' up the stairs
So I'm pullin' up a chair
And I'm puttin' up my hair
Baby, I think you were made for me
Somebody write down the recipe
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
You're just so sweet
I'll run a shower for you like you want
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
Huh

To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change , you could borrow
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby
Birds of a feather, we should stick together
, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
I said you
You were the love of my life
The love of my life
Did I break your heart?
Did I waste your time?
I tried to be there for you
Then you tried to break mine
It isn't asking for a lot for an apology
For making me feel like it'd kill you if I tried to leave
You said you'd never fall in love again because of me
Then you moved on immediately
But I wish you the best for the rest of your life
Felt sorry for you when I looked in your eyes
But I need to confess, I told you a lie
When I said you
You  were the love of my life
The love of my life

Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

Khalid
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (
Found
But you never go away (
Never go away
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
with Khalid
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
with Billie Eilish
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
Hmm
Well, good things don't last
And life moves so fast
I'd never ask who was better
'Cause she couldn't be
More different from me
Happy and free in leather

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
f "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

Billie
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Mehki Raine
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue
Bury a friend, try to wake up
Cannibal class, killing the son
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me

I miss you, I miss you
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
I miss you, miss you
I miss you, miss you
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating
Say it ain't so,
I will not go
Turn the lights off
, carry me home
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feelin' right
We started makin' out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV
with Tom DeLonge
away from me
Nobody likes you when you're
twenty-three
And are still more amused by
TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy
with Tom DeLonge
up on me
Nobody likes you when you're
twenty-three
And are still more amused by
prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

A popular song by Blink-182 describing a young boy’s suicide note. It’s a break from their usual light-hearted material, but the end is still life affirming as he decides not to go through with it.
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

Strangers, from strangers into brothers
From brothers into strangers once again
We saw the whole world, but I couldn't see the meaning
I couldn't even recognize my friends
Older, but nothing's any different
Right now feels the same, I wonder why
I wish they told us, it shouldn't take a sickness
Or airplanes falling out the sky
Do I have to die to hear you miss me?
Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?
I don't wanna act like there's tomorrow
I don't wanna wait to do this one more time
One morе time
One more
Onе more time
One more time
I miss you, took time, but I admit it
It still hurts even after all these years
And I know that next time ain't always gonna happen
I gotta say "I love you" while we're here

Get ready for action!
I got no regret right now
The air is so cold and low
Let me go in her room
I wanna take off her clothes
Show me the way to bed
Show me the way you move
Fuck it, it's such a blur
I love all the things you do
Mark Hoppus
Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear
Our breathing's got too loud
Show me the bedroom floor
Show me the bathroom mirror
We're taking this way too slow
Take me away from here

It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down
The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short,
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now
And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone, I won't come back

In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat
Let's go, don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

“Stay Together For the Kids” is written from the point of view of a child with divorced parents. Dual vocalists Tom Delonge and Mark Hoppus were growing up when both their parents divorced.
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time,
you gave it all away
It was mine
, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants
Then why's there so much pain?

I ain't that cool, a little fucked in the head
They'll be hangin' me quick when I'm back from the dead
Get the rope, get the rope
Get the rope, get the rope
I'm a punk rock kid, I came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it away, so
I fucked her in church
Don't you know? Don't you know?
Don't you know? Yeah, don't you know?
They say, "You're not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp, no way"
Mark Hoppus
No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at thе mess we started
Oh no, I lеave the broken hearts this way (
This way
Whatcha say? (
Whatcha say?
) Wanna play?
Yeah, don't be fooled, I'm only lettin' you down
They pursued me on foot, but I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost, like a ghost
Like a ghost, like a ghost
The seats of my car are filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eye, a little blood on my shirt
Let's hit the road, hit the road
Hit the road, hit the road
I know there's a special place in hell
That my friends and I know well
There's a perfect place to go
When it's time to lose control

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands, they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you, all night, always
And I'll miss your laugh, your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you tell me
I'm so sick of fights, I hate them
Let's start this again, for real
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
I'm not coming home
Mark Hoppus
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
I'm not coming home

I said, "Settle down, settle down, everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor"
She said, "No, I'm not, no, I'm not, no, I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door"
She's a-a-a-antisocial, a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-and she's an angel, yeah
Hoppus
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
She said "Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt,
and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind, oh yeah
Matt Skiba
We all need something to live for
, oh yeah
We all need something to live for
She said, I let her down, let her down, I no longer dream
Of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all, "You make me want to scream"
And threw herself on the floor

It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, I could never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this, I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel if I should choose to go?
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me?
Another guy, you think he'd wanna fight me?
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
I heard it once, I'm sure I've heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say, "You've got to turn your back and run, now"
"Come on, son, you haven't got a chance now"
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

Mark Hoppus
I wanna fuck a dog in the ass,
he wants to
Fuck a dog in the ass
I wanna fuck a dog
, that's right kids
I tried to fuck your mom in the ass, tried to fuck your dad in the ass
Could only find the dog and his ass
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna
Fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna fuck a dog
Mark Hoppus
I tried to fuck a fucking pirate in the ass,
arr, me and me
First mate,
ya scurvy cur!
Tried to fuck a fucking pirate
But I found the dog,
arr, that was no pirate, man
That was thy own sister!
It's a Mexican pirate
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna
Fuck a dog in the ass, wanna fuck a fucking dog
Fuck you!

Got a lotta heartache
, he's a fuckin' weasel
His issues make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions you do with your pigtails
What a nice creation, worth another night in jail
He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with Mom and trying on his father's tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag
So all you little ladies, be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe, I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heartache, he's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl will choose the guy that makes you wanna kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy that took her and ran away, and

“The Rock Show” explores the thoughts and behavior of a teenage punk-rocker who goes to the Vans Warped Tour, and subsequently falls in love with a girl there.
Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there
She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation

Hey Mom, there's something in the backroom
Hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories, as if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb
What if people knew that these were real?
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say, "What you hear is all hearsay"
Wish someone would tell me what was right
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you
I am still a skeptic, yes, you know me
Been best friends and will be 'til we die
I got an injection of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies, alright

Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because
, yeah, just because
And my girlfriend likes UL and DHC
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer
And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation
And I see her pretty face, it takes me away to a better place, and
Mark Hoppus
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything,
everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything,
everything's gonna be fine

Travis Barker
The drops of rain, they fall all over
This awkward silence makes me crazy
The glow inside burns light upon her
I'll try to kiss you if you let me
This can't be the end
Tidal waves, they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, it gets me so
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, it gets me so
Travis Barker
Your vows of silence fall all over
The look in your eyes makes me crazy
I feel the darkness break upon her
I'll take you over if you let me
You did this

Blame it, blame it on my youth
I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance
It's too late
Can you forgive me now?
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

Is it better?
Is it better now?
Are we better?
Are we better now?
Is it better?
Is it better now?
Are we better?
Are we better now?
Mark Hoppus
All we needed was your lifeline
We swore we'd be better than the last time
Don't leave, tell me that you're all right
I'm not the generational divide

Hey, kid, don't quit your daydream yet
I know you feel locked out in the cold
Seems like you’re lost and alone
Hey, kid, don't listen to your head
It only fills you with dread and with doubt
Left looking for an easy way out
I know you don't know
Oh no, you don’t know
I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
Walls of isolation inside of my pain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change
I wanna feel happy days, happy days
Happy days, happy days
All of this frustration inside of my brain
And I don't know if I'm ready to change
Some nights, you call for the jaws of life
To pull you out of the crash
A forgotten ghost from your past
When enough doesn't cut it
When you're backed up against a wall
Is it the life that you wanted
When you could never have it all?

She's a girl dressed in black from another world
Lives and breathes like a girl from another world
She don't know my name
She don't have the time of day
Celebrate, medicate 'til we numb the pain
In the sun‚ it's still dark‚ like it always rains
She don't feel the same
She don't have the time of day
And I wait‚ and I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait‚ and I wait
And I wait for her
And I wait, and I wait, and I wait
And I wait‚ and I wait, and I wait
And I wait for her
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I don't care what you say, no
I don't care what you do
I'm goin' to the darkside with you
I'm goin' to the darkside with you

I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you
A little drunk, waiting on your phone call
A little numb, maybe I can't feel at all
You stitch me up but you can’t stop me bleeding out
I'm better when I'm broken
I love you, but I hate you when you're with someone else
And I want you wrapped around me, but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house, but you don't live there anymore
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don’t really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now
Won't you say something?
Won’t you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

I miss you, I miss you
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
I miss you, miss you
I miss you, miss you
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stared, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating
Say it ain't so,
I will not go
Turn the lights off
, carry me home
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feelin' right
We started makin' out, and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV
with Tom DeLonge
away from me
Nobody likes you when you're
twenty-three
And are still more amused by
TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy
with Tom DeLonge
up on me
Nobody likes you when you're
twenty-three
And are still more amused by
prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

A popular song by Blink-182 describing a young boy’s suicide note. It’s a break from their usual light-hearted material, but the end is still life affirming as he decides not to go through with it.
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

Strangers, from strangers into brothers
From brothers into strangers once again
We saw the whole world, but I couldn't see the meaning
I couldn't even recognize my friends
Older, but nothing's any different
Right now feels the same, I wonder why
I wish they told us, it shouldn't take a sickness
Or airplanes falling out the sky
Do I have to die to hear you miss me?
Do I have to die to hear you say goodbye?
I don't wanna act like there's tomorrow
I don't wanna wait to do this one more time
One morе time
One more
Onе more time
One more time
I miss you, took time, but I admit it
It still hurts even after all these years
And I know that next time ain't always gonna happen
I gotta say "I love you" while we're here

Get ready for action!
I got no regret right now
The air is so cold and low
Let me go in her room
I wanna take off her clothes
Show me the way to bed
Show me the way you move
Fuck it, it's such a blur
I love all the things you do
Mark Hoppus
Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear
Our breathing's got too loud
Show me the bedroom floor
Show me the bathroom mirror
We're taking this way too slow
Take me away from here

It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down
The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short,
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now
And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone, I won't come back

In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat
Let's go, don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

“Stay Together For the Kids” is written from the point of view of a child with divorced parents. Dual vocalists Tom Delonge and Mark Hoppus were growing up when both their parents divorced.
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time,
you gave it all away
It was mine
, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants, and it's what she wants
Then why's there so much pain?

I ain't that cool, a little fucked in the head
They'll be hangin' me quick when I'm back from the dead
Get the rope, get the rope
Get the rope, get the rope
I'm a punk rock kid, I came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it away, so
I fucked her in church
Don't you know? Don't you know?
Don't you know? Yeah, don't you know?
They say, "You're not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp, no way"
Mark Hoppus
No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at thе mess we started
Oh no, I lеave the broken hearts this way (
This way
Whatcha say? (
Whatcha say?
) Wanna play?
Yeah, don't be fooled, I'm only lettin' you down
They pursued me on foot, but I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost, like a ghost
Like a ghost, like a ghost
The seats of my car are filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eye, a little blood on my shirt
Let's hit the road, hit the road
Hit the road, hit the road
I know there's a special place in hell
That my friends and I know well
There's a perfect place to go
When it's time to lose control

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands, they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you, all night, always
And I'll miss your laugh, your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you tell me
I'm so sick of fights, I hate them
Let's start this again, for real
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
I'm not coming home
Mark Hoppus
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
I'm not coming home

I said, "Settle down, settle down, everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor"
She said, "No, I'm not, no, I'm not, no, I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door"
She's a-a-a-antisocial, a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-and she's an angel, yeah
Hoppus
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
She said "Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt,
and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind, oh yeah
Matt Skiba
We all need something to live for
, oh yeah
We all need something to live for
She said, I let her down, let her down, I no longer dream
Of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all, "You make me want to scream"
And threw herself on the floor

It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, I could never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this, I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel if I should choose to go?
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me?
Another guy, you think he'd wanna fight me?
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
I heard it once, I'm sure I've heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say, "You've got to turn your back and run, now"
"Come on, son, you haven't got a chance now"
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

Mark Hoppus
I wanna fuck a dog in the ass,
he wants to
Fuck a dog in the ass
I wanna fuck a dog
, that's right kids
I tried to fuck your mom in the ass, tried to fuck your dad in the ass
Could only find the dog and his ass
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna
Fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna fuck a dog
Mark Hoppus
I tried to fuck a fucking pirate in the ass,
arr, me and me
First mate,
ya scurvy cur!
Tried to fuck a fucking pirate
But I found the dog,
arr, that was no pirate, man
That was thy own sister!
It's a Mexican pirate
We wanna fuck a dog in the ass, we wanna
Fuck a dog in the ass, wanna fuck a fucking dog
Fuck you!

Got a lotta heartache
, he's a fuckin' weasel
His issues make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions you do with your pigtails
What a nice creation, worth another night in jail
He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with Mom and trying on his father's tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag
So all you little ladies, be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe, I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heartache, he's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl will choose the guy that makes you wanna kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy that took her and ran away, and

“The Rock Show” explores the thoughts and behavior of a teenage punk-rocker who goes to the Vans Warped Tour, and subsequently falls in love with a girl there.
Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there
She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said, "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation

Hey Mom, there's something in the backroom
Hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories, as if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb
What if people knew that these were real?
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say, "What you hear is all hearsay"
Wish someone would tell me what was right
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you
I am still a skeptic, yes, you know me
Been best friends and will be 'til we die
I got an injection of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies, alright

Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because
, yeah, just because
And my girlfriend likes UL and DHC
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer
And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation
And I see her pretty face, it takes me away to a better place, and
Mark Hoppus
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything,
everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything,
everything's gonna be fine

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in,
when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free
Woah, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
Yeah, you give love a bad name
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for faith-departed
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
It's my life, it's now or never
But I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
Yeah, this is for ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's gettin' harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, gotta make your own breaks
It's my life, and  it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

It's all the same, only the names will change
Every day it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted  dead or alive
Wanted  dead or alive
Oh, and I ride

This Romeo is bleedin'
, but you can't see his blood
It's nothin' but some feelin's that this old dog kicked up
It's been rainin' since you left me, now I'm drownin' in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter, but without you, I give up
I can't sing a love song like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore, but baby, that's just me
Yeah, I will love you, baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I love you
Always
Now your pictures that you left behind are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry, one that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair, to touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take's on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true

I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I pray to God you'll give me one more chance, girl
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
Riche Sambora
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
And baby, you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valen
tine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine, woah

On the street where you live
They're made of lipstick, plastic, and paint
A touch of sable in their eyes
All your life all you've asked
When's your daddy gonna talk to you?
But you were livin' in another world
Tryna get a message through
No one heard a single word you said
They shoulda seen it in your eyes
What was goin' 'round your head
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Take a line every night, guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, callin' for a wild time
So you sit home alone, 'cause there's nothin' left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you

Shoulda seen it coming when the roses died
Shoulda seen the end of summer in your eyes
Shoulda listened when you said goodnight
You really meant goodbye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees and think you're standin' tall
But only fools are know-it-alls and I played that fool for you
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby
If the love that I've got for you's gone
And if the river I've cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancin' at the masquerade?
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades and some things never change

I was walkin' around, just a face in the crowd
Tryna keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown
Wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Whose singin' old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare these days
She came lookin' for some shelter
With a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's tryna be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples
And all the wannabes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothin' to hold on to but these days
These days the stars ain't out of reach
These days there ain't a ladder on the streets
On, no, no, these days are fast, nothin' lasts
In this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
I ain't got a fever, got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money, but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms, count 'em, one, two, three
First, you need
Then you bleed
And when you're on your knees
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug
Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

It's hard for me to say the things I wanna say sometimes
There's no one here but you and me and that broken old street light
Lock the doors, we'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
are these five words tonight
Thank you for lovin' me
For bein' my eyes when I couldn't see
For partin' my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for lovin' me
Thank you for lovin' me
I never knew I had a dream until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes, the sky's a different blue
Cross my heart, I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe that you believed my lies
Thank you for lovin' me
For bein' my eyes when I couldn't see
For partin' my lips when I couldn't breathe
Thank you for lovin' me
Thank you for lovin' me

Hey, man, I'm alive
I'm taking each day and night at a time
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
Hey my name is Jim, where did I go wrong?
My life's a bargain basement and all the good shit's gone
Just can't hold a job, where do I belong?
Been sleeping in my car, my dreams moved on
My name is Billie Jean, my love is bought and sold
I'm only sixteen, I feel a hundred years old
My foster daddy went, took my innocence away
The street life ain't much better, but at least I'm getting paid
And Tuesday just might go my way
Can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive
Hey, man, I'm alive
I'm taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey hey, man, gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothing but this roll of the dice
I'm feeling like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night

Mother, mother, tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won
Father, father, please believe me
I am layin' down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me
Forgive your wayward son
Mother, mother
Please believe me
And it's hard to hold on when there's no one to lean on
You know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Don't you let your love turn to hate
Now we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith

As I sit in this smoky room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Rememberin' when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat, baby
Remember how we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
Remember days of skippin' school
Racin' cars and bein' cool
With a six-pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me, we had a fight
But the band, they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong

Why you wanna tell me how to live my life?
And who are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference 'tween a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shinin' like a diamond, rollin' with the dice
Standin' on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say have a nice day
Have a nice day
Take a look around you, nothin's what it seems
We're livin' in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helpin' hand
Of anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Lookin' for forgiveness and what's left to believe

Shot through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love
Would you be content to see me cryin'?
After all those little games you put me through
After all I've done for you, you're lyin'
Wouldn't it be nice to tell the truth?
Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're gonna take a fall?
I gave you everything
Now here's the curtain call
And I'm shot through the heart
As I lay there alone in the dark
Through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love
Now you've come back here to say you're sorry, hah!
I just don't know who you're talkin' to
It could be the man I used to be, girl
I've grown up and now I'm over you

If you could see inside my heart
Then you would understand
I'd never mean to hurt you
Baby, I'm not that kind of man
I might not say I'm sorry
Yeah, I might talk tough sometimes
And I might forget the little things
Or keep you hangin' on the line
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
Into the fire, we cry
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
I'd do anything
I'd lie for you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
If it came right down to me and you
You know it's true
Baby, I'd die for you

Two, three, four!
Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay
But we got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothin' when I'm by your side
We got somethin' that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride
My heart beats like a drum
Flesh to flesh, one to one
And I'll never let go 'cause there's somethin' I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
Baby, I was made to be your man
We got somethin' to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet He must've had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because
My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess, I still believe
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Mmm, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, baby
Oops, I did it again,
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
, oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love, that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
You see, my problem is this
I'm dreamin' away
Wishin' that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

Baby, can't you see I'm callin'?
A guy like you should wear a warnin'
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's gettin' late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's takin' over me

It's Britney, bitch
I see you
And I just wanna dance with you
Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room
We can get down
Like there's no one around
We keep on rocking
We keep on rocking
Cameras are flashing
While we're dirty dancing
They keep watching
Keep watching,
feels like the crowd is saying
Gimme, gimme , gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme , gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme , gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme , gimme
Gimme, gimme

Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said, "I want your body now"
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said, "I want your body now"
Would you hold it against me?
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out, 'cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it, you notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good
-ish
, sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waiting for?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

“I Wanna Go” is the third single from Femme Fatale, released on June 13, 2011.
Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out
Shame on me
To need release
Un-un-uncontrollably
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind, woah
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind, woah
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the bla-blanket
When the light's out

You wanna?
You wanna?
You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti?
You want a Maserati? You better work, bitch
You want a Lamborghini? Sip martinis?
Look hot in a bikini?
You better work, bitch
You wanna live fancy? Live in a big mansion?
Party in France?
You better work, bitch
You better work, bitch, you better work, bitch
You better work, bitch
Now get to work, bitch
Now get to work, bitch
Bring it on, ring the alarm
Don't stop now, just be the champion
Work it hard like it's your profession
Watch out now, 'cause here it comes

La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
Oh, baby, baby, have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom? Is she smoking up outside? (
Oh, baby, baby, does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'ma buy her? Do you know just what she likes? (
Oh, oh, tell me, have you seen her?
'Cause I'm so, oh, I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gon' go
Can somebody take me home?
Ha-ha, hee-hee, ha-ha, ho
Love me, hate me, say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la

Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time
I don't wanna be so shy, uh-oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

This is a story about a girl named Lucky
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say
"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But, mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh-oh, I know, oh
Should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first (
Oh, oh
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (
Call the shots
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot
when I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

Friday
I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowin' up to the ceiling, we burnin' bright when we cut the light
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always sayin', "Little girl, don't step into the club"
Well, I'm just tryna find out why, 'cause dancing's what I love, yeah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it , get it, get it, woah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, uh
I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talkin', feel like dancin' when I see this guy
What's practical? What's logical? What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancin' there
I'm a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you
I won't deny it, I'm not tryna hide it

Tonight
I just wanna take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right
Players
Put your pinky rings up to the moon
Girls, what y'all tryna do?
24-karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Look out, uh
Pop-pop, it's show time , show time
Guess who's back again?
Oh, they don't know?  Oh, they don't know?
I bet they know as soon as we walk in
Wearin' Cuban links , designer minks
Inglewood's finest shoes
Don't look too hard, might hurt yourself
Known to give the color red the blues
Woo, shit
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
So many pretty girls around me and they wakin' up the rocket
Why you mad? Fix your face, ain't my fault they all be jockin'
Players only, come on

Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

Drop top Porsche , Rollie on my wrist
Diamonds up and down my chain
Cardi B, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook
My big fat ass got all them boys hooked
Went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands
Bruno sang to me while I do my money dance like
Ayy, flexin' on the 'Gram like
Ayy, hit the Lil Jon
Okay , okay
Oh, yeah, we drippin' in finesse and gettin' paid, ow
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight, I'm gonna show you off
When I walk in with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence or blame it on your measurements
Shut the shit down on sight
That's right

Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us, all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now
So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Ooh, I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
I'll unzip the back and watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door
'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing
Sayin', "There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of somethin' they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

Mark Ronson
One, two, one, two, three
Aw, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimmin' in your water's somethin' spiritual
I'm born again every time you spend the night, —ight
'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked outta heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked outta heaven
For too long
For too long

Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had ya eyes wide open, uh, why were they open?
Gave you all I had, and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what ya don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya , oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no-oh-oh-oh

Megan Vick for Billboard explained the meaning of the song:
The song is about Bruno professing “his love for a beautiful girl who occupies his dreams”.
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful, uh
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah

Oh, thinkin' about our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more
Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in Heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
Isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven
Oh, once in your life, you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh, there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way

When it's love you give
I'll be a man of good faith
Then in love you'll live
I'll make a stand, I won't break
I'll be the rock you can build on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold
When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong
Then there's a reason why
I'll prove to you we belong
I'll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain
Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold, be the one you want
The one you need
Cause when it's all for one, it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
To really love a woman - Let her hold you
'Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the Five and Dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
Should've known we'd never get far
Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life
Hey!
Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Look into my eyes, you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
And when you find me there, you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do, I do it for you
Look into your heart, you will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do, I do it for you
Oh, yeah
There's no love like your love
And no other could give more love
There's nowhere unless you're there
All the time, all the way, yeah

She says her love for me could never die
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I
Oh, but her love is cold
Wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cause
When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you
'Cause when the feeling's right, I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you
She's got a heart of gold, she'd never let me down
But you're the one that always turns me on, you keep me comin' 'round
I know her love is true
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you
I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch

Still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss and it's gettin' better baby
No one can better this
Still holdin' on, you're still the one
First time our eyes met the same feeling I get
Only feels much stronger, I wanna love you longer
You still turn the fire on
So if you're feelin' lonely, don't
You're the only one I ever want
I only wanna make it good
So if I love you a little more than I should
Please forgive me, I know not what I do
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Don't deny me this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do
Please believe me, every word I say is true
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
Still feels like our best times are together
Feels like the first touch
We're still gettin' closer baby
Can't get close enough
I'm still holdin' on, you're still number one
I remember the smell of your skin
I remember everything
I remember all your moves, I remember you
I remember the night, you know I still do

Bryan Adams
I finally found someone
Who knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one
Who makes me feel complete
It started over coffee
We started out as friends
It's funny how from simple things
The best things begin
This time is different
la la la la
It's all because of you
la la la la
It's better than it's ever been
'Cause
we can talk it through
My favorite line
Was "Can I call you sometime?"
It's all you had to say
take my breath away
, Barbra Streisand,
Bryan Adams
This is it
Oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
'Cause whatever I do
it's just got to be you
My life has just begun, I finally found someone
Ooooh, someone
I finally found someone
Ooooh

I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone, we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart
You say it's easy, but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart
Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go, as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart
I see you on the street some other time
And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart
Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go, as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

When you love someone, you'll do anything
You'll do all the crazy things that you can't explain
You'll shoot the moon, put out the sun
When you love someone
You'll deny the truth, believe a lie
There'll be times that you'll believe you could really fly
But your lonely nights have just begun
When you love someone
When you love someone, you'll feel it deep inside
And nothing else could ever change your mind
When you want someone, when you need someone
When you love someone
When you love someone, you'll sacrifice
You'd give it everything you got and you won't think twice
You'd risk it all, no matter what may come
When you love someone

When you're gone
I've been wandering around the house all night
Wondering what the hell to do
Yeah, I'm trying to concentrate
But all I can think of is you
Well, the phone don't ring 'cause my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on 'cause the radio's playing
Songs that remind me of you
Bryan Adams
Baby, when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Baby, when you're gone
Yeah

Written by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance.
Drivin' home this evenin'
Coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this boy believin'
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt, Yeah
Well, I heard it on the street
I heard you might've found somebody new, Yeah
Well, who is he, baby?
Who is he and tell me what he means to you? Oh, yeah
I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go
Now it cuts like a knife!
But it feels so right
Yeah, it cuts like a knife
Oh, but it feels so right
There's times I've been mistaken
There's times I thought I'd been misunderstood, Ooh, yeah
So wait a minute, darlin'
Can't you see we did the best we could?
Ooh, we could

Yeah, yeah
Here I am, this is me
There's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be
Here I am, it's just me and you
Tonight we make our dreams come true
It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
Here I am
Here I am
Here we are, we've just begun
And after all this time, our time has come
Yeah, here we are, still goin' strong
Right here in the place where we belong
Oh, it's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you

Sound the bugle now, play it just for me
As the seasons change, remember how I used to be
Now I can't go on, I can't even start
I got nothing left, just an empty heart
I'm a soldier, wounded so I must give up the fight
There's nothing more for me, lead me away
Or leave me lying here
Sound the bugle now, tell them I don't care
There's not a road I know that leads to anywhere
Without a light, I fear that I will stumble in the dark
Lay right down, decide not to go on
Then from on high, somewhere in the distance
There's a voice that calls, "Remember who you are
If you lose yourself, your courage soon will follow
So be strong tonight, remember who you are"
Yeah, you're a soldier now, fighting in a battle
To be free once more
Yeah, that's worth fighting for

I hear the wind call my name
The sound that leads me home again
It sparks up the fire, a flame that still burns
To you I will always return
I know the road is long but where you are is home
Wherever you stay, I'll find the way
I'll run like the river, I'll follow the sun
I fly like an eagle to where I belong
I can't stand the distance, I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you, yes, I'm on my way home
And now I know it's true
My every road leads to you
And in the hour of darkness
Your light gets me through
You run like the river, you shine like the sun
You fly like an eagle
Yeah, you are the one
I've seen every sunset
And with all that I've learned
Oh, it's to you I will always, always return

Here I am, this is me
I come into this world so wild and free
Here I am, so young and strong
Right here in the place where I belong
It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
It's a new day in a new land
And it's waiting for me
Here I am
Oh, it's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
Yeah, it's a new day in a new land
And it's waiting for me
Here I am

I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear
All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms
Layin', we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde, huh
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Hey!
Now nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe
And do you mind if I steal a kiss?
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here
Just wanna feel it from you
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

Ah-ooh, ooh, ah-ooh
I want you to breathe me in
Let me be your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition, no fear
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?
Hit me harder again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer again
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
How deep is your love?
Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh

Are you drunk enough
Not to judge what I'm doin’?
Are you high enough
To excuse that I'm ruined? 'Cause I’m ruined
Is it late enough
For you to come and stay over?
'Cause we're free to love
So tease me, ooh

Is it loud enough?
’Cause my body is callin' for ya, callin’ for ya
I need someone
To do the things that I do, mhm
I'm heatin' up
Energy's takin’ control
I'm speedin' up
My heartbeat's dancin' alone

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
Got L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci
Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
They deserve Whammys, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh

You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way
We say nothin' more than we need
I say, "Your place" when we leave
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh

Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothin' left
Hey, I've been wantin' to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you cryin'
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checkin' if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "let go" if you're still holdin' it?
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at fakin' it than me, baby
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
, ay
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Something in you-ou-ou
Lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

Look at what you've done
Stand still, fallin' away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?
Now I'm holdin' on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day, I'll be watching you
Oh-ah, oh-ah
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh-ah
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside, oh-ah
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh-ah
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love
I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there, but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushin' out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now
So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

I don't really care if your tears fall down your face
You know you play the victim every time
I know you gettin' turnt every night, oh yeah
Your girls ain't shit, tryna get me off your mind
The same ones who be hittin' up my line
They're not your friends
I need you to know that
We ain't ever gonna go back
This time, it got so bad
It's best for me, it's best for you
I need you to know that
Tried to love you, but I forced that
All signs, we ignored that
And it's not the same
'Cause it's over now, oh yeah
Don't get too confused, girl, it's over now, oh yeah, uh
No comin' back around, baby
Nothin' left to lose, girl, it's over now
So, I take this just to forget you
I don't regret those memories
And I swear I'm not tryna test
I wish you the best with the life you lead
But you always need that attention
Feedin' the press, when we don't speak
But we're both with somebody else
So please stop callin' me

Won't you please
Slow it down?
I'm tryna talk to you, darlin'
Tryna walk with you, darlin'
Do you hear me?
And no-no-no-no-nobody can stop it
The love you got from me
And every time, I look out at my seat today
They chase, they flash they flash, yes
Tell me how you feel right now
'Cause all I wanna do is keep it real right now
I'm tryna beat it up, Beat Pills right now
Athletic in the sheets, I got skills right
now
Break bread with some red baby hair
Ballin' in the club, Ace of Spades, yeah
Pop that bitch and spray it like 'Raid'
Yellow diamonds on you like a glass of lemonade
QB, I'll throw it
Teeth white, Newports
I want knees like shorts
80 thousand dollar Birkin bag in the Porsche
I'm tryna fuck with you 'til we on life support
I'll split it with you if we get half of Michael Jordan
No toilet tissue, I shit on niggas 'cause life is short
No passport to go with me, I had to get deported

Why wait to say? At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two-faced, but in my heart, I understand
I made my move, and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way, oh, way, oh, way, oh, way
My way
My way
My way
Why wait to say? At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two-faced, but in my heart, I understand
I made my move, and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed

The song was announced on social media four days before its release:
I understood loneliness before I knew what it was
Saw the pills on the table for your unrequited love
Well, I would be nothing without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant (
Ooh
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (
Ooh
We'll be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
Don't hide your emotions, you can throw down your guard
And feed from the notion we can be who we are
You taught me something, yeah, freedom is ours
It was you who taught me living is
Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness
I am a giant
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant

Oh, woah-woah
I don't like to talk, but I love to sing
And I don't smoke, but I love to drink
I'm paranoid, I don't miss a thing
But I'm still nice, at least that's what I think
Fall in love, like I'm a fiend
But then I pull out and say
"I need freedom, I need freedom"
Woah-woah
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
Oh, baby, I'd rather be hard to love than easy to leave
You should believe me, I'll make you need me (
Listen
I'd rather be hard to love than easy to leave
You should believe me, I'll make you need me (
Yeah
'Course you love me, you don't know me
But I got news for you, I came broken
Ego issues, my head is swollen (
Oh, woah-woah
I got a million chips on my shoulder
But if you stick despite all I showed ya
Maybe you don't need freedom, freedom

Oh-oh, oh, oh, ah
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have travelled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever
Exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay
Strollin' so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be

I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringin' me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singin' on my own
Now I can't find the key without you
And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
I'm sorry if it's all too much
Every day you're here, I'm healin'
And I was runnin' outta luck
I never thought I'd find this feelin'
'Cause I've been hearin' symphonies
Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless

Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration, foundation
A special bond of creation, ha
For all the single moms out there
Goin' through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean da Paul
Anne-Marie, sing, make them hear
Sean Paul
She works the nights by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (
Daily struggle
Sean Paul
She tells him, "Ooh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
Stay up there, stay up there
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gon' be nothin' like my life (
Straight
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"
Stay up there, stay up there

I know you're out in Cabo
Hanging with your brother
Wishin' that I was your bottle
So I could be close to your lips again
I know you didn't call your parents
And tell 'em that we ended
'Cause you know that they'd be offended
Did you not want to tell 'em it's the end?
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So, I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Oh, I can't believe it, I
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I'm tryin' not to right now
You weren't a fan of pictures
So I hardly ever took 'em
Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom
So that way I can't forget your skin
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was

It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, e-e-e-everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you (
It solo, solo, everybody
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool (
It solo, solo, everybody
Since you've been gone
I've been dancin' on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause, baby, you're
The only one I'm comin' for
I can't take no more
No more, no more
I wanna f— , but I'm brokenhearted
Cry-cry-cry, but I like to party
Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f— , but I'm brokenhearted
Cry-cry-cry since the day we parted
Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

I tried hard to make you want me
But we're not supposed to be
And the truth will always haunt me
Even though it set me free
And my tears flow like the ocean
As they floated in the breeze
They were falling in slow motion
And they brought me to my knees
You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you
Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

Sé que te gusto a ti todavía
Tres, dos, uno
Standing here in an empty room
I saw you there, and my blood ran cold
Take me back to that long September
Don't know how I ever let you go
I was young, didn't know 'bout love
You were wild, couldn't get enough
Gave my heart to another lover
Don't know how I ever let you go
Find me in another place and time
If only, if only you were mine
But I'm already someone else's baby
Luis Fonsi
Guess I had my last chance
And now this is our last dance
You fell through the cracks in my hands
Hard to say it's over
But I'm already someone else's (
C'mon
Baby, ah
Baby, ah
Baby, ah
I'm already someone else's

She works the nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come, she's got to save him
She tells him, "Oh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you"
She tells him, "Your life
Ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do"
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye
No, oh-oh
Rockabye

Kamille
I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you (
It solo, solo, everybody
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool (
It solo, solo, everybody
Since you been gone
I've been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby, you're the only one I'm coming for
I can't take no more, no more, no more
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry, but I like to party
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna fuck, but I'm broken hearted
Cr-cr-cry since the day we parted
T-t-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?
I see my body in a different light, ay ay ay
As if I woke up in a different life, ay ay ay
Feels like I'm walking with my heart on fire
Somebody pass me the water 'cause I'm burning
'Cause a little bit's turning into a lot
There's no way I'll be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought I was not
Tell me, tell me, ay ay ay
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la
Oh, what do I do now?

Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
I don't need no other, I'm satisfied
Doing it on my own
Only takes one lover to change your vibe
Ain't that the way it go?
I don't need nobody, but you're on replay
Caught in the memory
When you touch my body and you say my name
Giving me what I need
Every minute, so lost in it
Like you're in my bed
Every hour, give you power
I'm losing mine instead
24/7, got you on my mind
Think about you all the time
My body wants you night and day
But my head is screaming, "Go away"
24/7, got you on my mind
Darling, I don't have the time
My body wants you night and day
I'm losing all control of me

I've been feeling anxious, ain't been feeling right
I've been staying up, yeah, staying up all night
I've been calling exes, tryna disconnect
I can't cut the wires running 'round my head, head
Need to look after myself
Yeah, I need to take a breath
Need to look after my health
Yeah, I need to disconnect
Yeah, I need to take a breath, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, I need to disconnect, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I go all out all night, yeah, I go home alone
Sleeping in my bed, head beside my phone
Looking at a screen glowing in the dark
I just wanna dream, but I can't seem to switch off
Need to look after myself
Yeah, I need to take a breath
Need to look after my health
Yeah, I need to disconnect

I know what you did last night
I called you up and you declined
I smell perfume, but it ain't mine
It's not okay, but it's alright
'Cause you telling so many lies, I gotta let you go
Now you know what it's like to be all alone
Tell me, how you gonna hurt the one that loves you the most?
'Cause your tears gon' cry a river, go, let it flow
Don't want no cry baby at my door, I'll let him go
Boy, I ain't the same girl I was before
You're only crying 'cause I don't want you back no more
Boy, you had your chance
And you can keep on cryin', baby
I know you been lyin', baby
So you can keep on cryin', baby
I don't know what you're waiting for
I packed your bags outside the door, uh
No, I don't wanna sit and talk
Can you hurry up? I'm bored

“Real Love” follows up Clean Bandit and Jess Glynne’s worldwide hit, “Rather Be”.
This similarly upbeat classical house joint expands on Rather’s theme, celebrating genuine romance.
Oh, you've got the feeling that I wanna feel
Oh, you've got the feeling that I know is real, real, real
It's in the way you look, it's in the way you love
And I can see that this is real, real
It's in the way you talk, it's in the way you touch
And I can see
This is real, real, real, real love
This is real, real, real, real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling
You give me that, you give me real love
Oh, before you I was searching for a rarity
Oh, you showed me things I never thought that I would see
It's in the way you look, it's in the way you love
And I can see that this is real, real
It's in the way you talk, it's in the way you touch
And I can see

People tell me to be cautious
People tell me not to lose my self-control
People tell me to be flawless
People tell me not to let myself evolve
And I think I don't really get it
I think it's all just a peculiar game
And soon I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And everyone will know me by a different name
Alex Newell
I wanted to be stronger (
Stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger, would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?
Gotta be stronger for you, baby
Love you like you want me to
Gotta be stronger for you, baby
Love you like you want me to
I held my breath every time
I tried to keep myself dry
But did I ask too much
If I could do it again
Would you believe what I said?
That I still want that rush

You can see there's something in the way
I've tried to show you, my door is open
I don't know how much more I can take
Since you've chosen to leave me frozen
Am I the only one who sees what you've become?
Will you drift away?
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you stay?
People making choices, they can't fake
Sacrifice it all and maybe say
Something extraordinary, something real
To fill my days and nights with something that I can feel
I'm not gonna compromise, surely you can sympathise?
Say you feel the same?
You've wandered down a path I can't explain
Have you seen her? The grass is greener
To let me pass you by would be a shame
If she's your only, then why are you lonely?
Cause I'm the only one who knows the things you've done
I'm so good for you
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
Could I make you do?

Bhad Bhabie
Uh, oh damn
Uh, uh, oh damn
It's Clean Bandit
With Charli XCX and Bhad Bhabie, bitch
Had a lover undercover, kept it on the low
Said that you meant nothing but my feelings really grew
Not that I regret you but I met you, went insane
Oh, oh, yeah
Didn't need forever but I needed just a call
Every night at 3 A.M I'm banging on your door
Crying on the marble where we used to fuck 'til dawn
Oh, oh
What're you doing to me?
Used to be a scene from a movie
Now I'm crying tears like a baby
Looking in the mirror, I don't know me
Oh, yeah yeah
Fell in love with a bad, bad dude
Playboy style, should've seen right through
All my friends, they could see the truth
You never loved me, you never loved me, yeah yeah
It's so rare for a girl like me
Playboy style, got me fallin' deep
Did that dirt and I got receipts
You never loved me, you never loved me, yeah yeah

Under my skin, under my skin
Got me strugglin'
Don't know where you end and where I begin
And we feel incredible, we feel no pain
You got me feelin' insane, got me strugglin'
Don't know where you end and where I begin
Had my head underwater
Had my mind under covers
Had my faith in the gutter
Underwater, water, water, water, water, oh
But when you look at me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Nothing matters at all
When I see you with your
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher

I'm out of your control
There's nowhere left to hide
Packed my bags at midnight
And leave this mess behind
Me, myself and I
Have read between the lines
Left the engine runnin'
I guess this is goodbye
And you're never gonna change my mind
We've been here about a thousand times
Should've never let you back inside
Inside my mind
Should've known better than to let you break my heart
I should've known better, I believed you from the start
I should've known better, and now we wasted all this time
I should've known better, so I'm taking back my life
Should've known better than that
Ah, better
Should've known better than that
Ah, better
I should've known better than that

I never said any of this was gonna be simple
But sometimes all it takes is just a symbol, ooh oh
Because the place you want to reach is right in front of you
You're getting stronger
So just keep on that bit longer
Ra pa pum
Girl come over
Mi want you closer
Tired of the rainy days
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine
So before the night's over
I want you to know that
I'm willing to change my ways
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sunshine
Come over, come over
Come over, come, come over
Come over, come over
Come over, come, come over

Continuing the existential themes of A Rush of Blood to the Head, “Clocks” opens with a haunting piano melody into Chris Martin’s falsetto vocals.
The lights go out, and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singin'
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waitin' to be tamed, singin'
You are
You are
Confusion never stops
Closin' walls and tickin' clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singin'
Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
And I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it?
I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I'll wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it?

“Violet Hill” is off of Coldplay’s album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends. It was their first attempt at a protest/political song.
It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops, I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows, they were watchin'
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low
If you love me
Won't you let me know?
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it
"Eating out of the trash"
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, "When you know, you know"
And, "When you don't, you don't"
And all of the foes, and all of the friends
Have seen it before, they'll see it again
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong
But my mama told me, "It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

Her name was Kitty
Made her money being pretty and witty
They gave her the keys to this city
Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
I bought a ticket
She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
Looking back, I guess it was kismet
I waited by the stage door,
packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name,
then glowing like the end of a cigarette, wow, she came out
I said, "You're living my drеam"
Then she said to me
"Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never, ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten, so
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna"

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the mornin', I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

“The Scientist” is a very mellow song about trying to analyze a broken relationship.
The song’s melody is inspired by “Don’t Look Back in Anger” by Oasis, especially the piano part.
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
And tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
No, let's go back to the start
Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessin' at numbers and figures
Pullin' your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
And tell me you love me,
come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Runnin' in circles, chasin' our tails
Comin' back as we are

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
) Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Ooh
) Turn into something beautiful
) And you know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streamin' down your face
When you lose somethin' you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try
to fix you

And said drink from me, drink from me
That we shoot across the sky
Got me feeling drunk and high
Poured on a symphony
So high, so high
That we shoot across the sky
Poured on a symphony
Drink from me, drink from me
That we shoot across the sky
Got me feelin' drunk and high
Poured on a symphony
So high, so high
That we shoot across the sky
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one we know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do
I say, oh
I say, oh
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold onto
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh, yeah, I will, yeah, I will, yes, I will
I said, oh
I cry, oh
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I think I see you, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

"Turn your magic on," Umi, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
We are legends every day"
That's what she told me
"Turn your magic on," to me, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds"
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Said, "I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me"

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

The most personal and emotionally-charged song on Coldplay’s enigmatic A Head Full of Dreams, “Everglow” expresses memory and loss as an ever-lasting “glow.”
Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you celestial
Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars don't slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I can't let you go
But when I'm cold, cold
Yeah, when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feelin' within me, everglow
Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changin' of winds and the way waters flow
Life is short as the fallin' of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know

Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic when I'm with you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still I call it magic when I'm next to you
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still I call it magic, such a precious jewel
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

I want to know when I can go

Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon
She went
Indigo up in heaven today
Bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
She say
I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again

Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, won't you come and play?
Daddy, do you not care?
Is there nothing that you wanna say?
I know
You're hurting too
But I need you, I do
Daddy, if you're out there
Daddy, all I want to say
You're so far away
Oh, you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
I'm okay
Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, why'd you run away?
Daddy, are you okay?
Look, Dad, we got the same hair
And Daddy, it's my birthday
And all I wanna say

And you (

In the night, I lie and look up at you
When the morning comes, I watch you rise
There's a paradise they couldn't capture
That bright infinity inside your eyes

Eyes
And they said that we can't be togethеr
Because
becausе we come from different sides

I know that this could hurt me bad
I know that this could feel like that
But I just can't stop
Let my defences drop
I know that I was born to kill
Any angel on my windowsill
But it's so dark inside
I throw the windows wide
I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Still I don't let go
And fields of flowers grow
Oh, it feels like
I'm fallin' in love
Maybe for the first time
Baby, it's my mind you blow
It feels like
I'm fallin' in love
You're throwin' me a lifeline
This is for a lifetime, I know

"It's alright, it's alright," you said
I got my hands up shaking just to let you know

Oh no, I see
A spiderweb is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said
Oh no, what's this?
A spiderweb, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done
And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm
Oh no, I see
A spiderweb, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble
Singin' that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

What in the world are we going to do?
Look at what everybody's going through
What kind of world do you want it to be?
Am I the future or the history?
'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
Everyone falls, everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
How in the world am I going to see
You as my brother, not my enemy?
'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone sees the colour in each other's eyes
Everyone loves, everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
Hold tight for everyday life
Hold tight for everyday life
At first light, throw my arms out, open wide
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
"You remind me of a younger me," I saw potential
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, "They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign"
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

You thought that it would be okay, at first
The situation could be saved, of course
But they'd already picked out your grave and hearse
Beware the wrath of masked crusaders
Did you girlboss too close to the sun?
Did they catch you having far too much fun?
Come with me, when they see us, they'll run
Something wicked this way comes
Good thing I like my friends cancelled
I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour,
and poison thorny flowers
Welcome to my underworld where it gets quite dark
At least you know exactly who your friends are
They're the ones with matching scars
It's easy to love you when you're popular
The optics click, everyone prospers
But one single drop, you're off the roster
"Tone-deaf and hot, let's fucking off her"

You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
Shoot me down, but I get up
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud, not saying much
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

“2U” is a romantic ode to a woman who is worth the chase and time she demands.
No limit in the sky that I won't fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes that I won't cry for ya, ooh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart when it comes to you
Comes to you
Want you to share that
When it comes to you
Cupid ain't a lie, arrow got your name on it, ooh, yeah
Don't miss out on a love and regret yourself on it, ooh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, ooh

Be my woman, girl, I'll
be your man
Be my woman, girl, I'll
be your man
Yes, I'll be your woman, yes, I'll be your baby
Yes, I'll be whatever that you tell me when you're ready
Yes, I'll be your girl, forever your lady
You ain't ever gotta worry, I'm down for you, baby
Best believe that when you need that
I'll provide that, you will always have it
I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that, I'ma let you have it
Beatin' my drum like, "Dum, di-di, day"
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like, "Hey, mama-ma-ma," "Hey, mama-ma" (
Hey
Bangin' the drum like, "Dum, di-di, day" (
Hey
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like, "Hey, mama-ma-ma," "Hey, mama-ma" (
Hey

You've been dressin' up the truth
I've been dressin' up for you
Then, you leave me in this room, this room
Pour a glass and bite my tongue
You say I'm the only one
If it's true then, why you runnin', you runnin'?
Ooh, woah
If you're really being honest
If you really want this, ooh, woah
Why you acting like a stranger?
What's with your behavior? Ooh, woah
Say my name, say my name
If you love me, let me hear you
Say my name, say my name
I am dyin' to believe you
I feel alone in your arms
I feel you breaking my heart
Say my name, say my name
If you love me, let me hear you
Let me hear you

I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
You know I'm down for whatever tonight
I don't need the finer things in life
No matter where I go, it's a good time, yeah
And I, I don't need to sit in VIP
Middle of the floor, that's where I'll be
Don't got a lot, but that's enough for me, yeah
'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
One foot in front of the other, babe
One breath leads to another, yeah
Just keep moving, oh, oh
Look within for the strength today
Listen out for the voice to say
Just keep moving, oh, oh
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, you can do this
So, my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today, yeah, yeah
There, my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay, oh
Oh, my love, don't stop burning
Gonna send them up in flames
In flames

I don't wanna lie, can we be honest?
Right now while you're sitting on my chest
I don't know what I'd do without your comfort
If you really go first, if you really left
I don't know if I would be alive today
With or without you like night and day
Read and repeat every conversation
Being with you, everyday is a Saturday
But every Sunday you've got me praying
Don't you ever leave me, don't you ever go
I've seen it on TV, I know how it goes
Even when you're angry, even when I'm cold
Don't you ever leave me, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me a—
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha
Ah, ah, alone
Ah, ah, ha

After collaborating together on “Where Them Girls At,” “Turn Me On” and “Hey Mama;” “Light My Body Up” marks the fourth time David Guetta and Nicki Minaj have worked together on a song.
Mm, yo
I just started my sentence like a capital letter
Got bars for years, I hope you send me a letter
Know she'll never be queen, so now she got a vendetta
I ain't talkin' 'bout David when I say I'ma get her
Twenty mil' on my off season of course
Twenty million when you ain't put out no album or tours
Yes, bitch, I'm me, pretty and icy

Four of hip-hop’s heavyweights take turns going in over a hard beat by Boi-1da.
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' 'ery girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, a—
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

You know, a lot of girls be
This is not to get confused
This one's for you
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had , best I ever had
Best I ever had , best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there
Yup
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Timbaland

Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Everybody get your mothafuckin' roll on

Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First-last, phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (
Alright!
It's a short life, yeah

D. Hill
D. Hill
Ayy
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires

Yeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
"Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"
June, you're a genius
I said, "I respect it, no problem"
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man
, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends
snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you
mad
at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn, coach, put him in"
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah

Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife

Black leather glove, no sequins
Buckles on the jacket, it's Alyx shit
Nike crossbody, got a piece in it
Got a dance, but it's really on some street shit

Left foot up, right foot, slide
Basically, I'm sayin' either way, we 'bout to slide, ayy

Left foot up, right foot, slide
Basically, I'm sayin', either way, we 'bout to slide, ayy

Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star-struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no, we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again
Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one

And they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 a.m. to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes, I won't, yeah
I feel good, sometimes, I don't
I finessed down Weston Road
Might go down a G-O-D

And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
TrapMoneyBenny, ayy
I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many

Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling

I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need, my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

You're everything that I see
I want your heart, love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me

You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

I can't get over you
You left your mark on me

15 Fort York shit, y'know?
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes

Sandra Graham
Nigga, I said it, I know that you mad
I've emptied the clip over friendlier jabs
You mentioned my seed, now deal with his dad
I gotta go bad, I gotta go bad
Mm, mm, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop a fifty bag for the mob in the spot
Drop a fifty bag, 29 for the thot
Uh, I was really, really tryna keep it PG
I was really, really tryna keep it PG
If you had a set, they'd give your ass a DP
But you civilian gang, in real life, you PC
You know who really bang a set? My nigga YG
You know who really bang a set? My nigga Chuck T
You know who even bang a set out there is CB
And, nigga, Cole losin' sleep on this, it ain't me
You better have some paperwork or that shit fake tea
Can't bе rappin' 'bout no rattin' that we can't read
I mean it's truе a nigga slimed me for my AP
Just like how Metro nigga slimed him for his main squeeze
Out here beggin' for attention, nigga, say please
Always rappin' like you 'bout to get the slaves freed
You just actin' like an activist, it's make-believe
Don't even go back to your hood and plant no money trees
Say you hate the girls I fuck, but what you really mean?
I been with Black and white and everything that's in between
You the Black messiah wifin' up a mixed queen
And hit vanilla cream to help out with your self-esteem
On some Bobby shit, I wanna know what Whitney need
All that puppy love was over in y'all late teens
Why you never hold your son and tell him, "Say cheese"?
We could've left the kids out of this, don't blame me
You a dog and you know it, you just play sweet
Your baby mama captions always screamin', "Save me"
You did her dirty all your life, you tryna make peace
I heard that one of 'em little kids might be Dave Free
Don't make it Dave Free's
'Cause if your GM is your BM secret BD
Then this is all makin' plenty fuckin' sense to me
Ayy, let that shorty breathe
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake, now shake that ass for free
Yeah, yeah
Well, not that kind of free, I'm talkin' 'bout my nigga Dave
Your man a lil' K, we call that shit a mini Drac'
He always said I overlooked him, I was starin' straight
These bars go over Kenny head no matter what I say
I know you like to keep it short, so let me paraphrase
Knew it was smoke when Abel hit us with the serenade
Nigga said, "Uh, uh"
Almost started reachin' for my waist

I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (
Yeah
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (
2 Chainz
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring,
doggin' these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert, ill nigga alert"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If havin' a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested

“From Time” is penned as a conversation between Drake and an old flame.
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
"Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?"
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all
Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it;

Yeah, that mean I'm way up
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season

I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker, that's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we could really get it, we could go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't made me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

Yeah, yeah
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really, you never were solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
You're not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone
Oh, but when you're gone, when you're gone, when you're gone
Oh, baby, all the lights go out
Thinking now that maybe I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
Oh, baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you, do for you, do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock
He can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You'd probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving till late in the night
Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, oh, same me
Inside
If you don't like the way I talk
Then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock
Then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue
You'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

One
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Something in you-ou-ou
Lit up heaven in me-e-e
The feeling won't let me slee-ee-eep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

If you don't wanna see me
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on , come on , come on
Let's get physical
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

J Balvin
Bad Bunny
You know that sometimes I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Eh-eh
Pero contigo es todo o na'
-eh
Yeah-yeah
You're deep in the water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now, but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

If you wanna
run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we
fell into
a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (
You're the
moonlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

Billboard Baby, Dua Lipa make 'em dance when it come on
Everybody lookin' for a dancefloor to run on
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yеah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, comе on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (
You're the moonlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv makin' dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbin' if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothin' but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal 'cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's gettin' dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities stickin' their noses in
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly

White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

It's late in the evenin', glass on the side
I've been sat with you for most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Louder
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Na-na-na-na
Mmm
I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Ooh, ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

Build the fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas
We'll
dance in the kitchen
while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bеautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas
The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

I met her smokin' a cigarette in a toilet cubicle
Red  dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful
This  ain't the time or place to start a future, but, darlin', I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere
Well, darlin', here we go again
We  are only man and woman and we all make mistakes
"Don't  you know we're only human?", is what I heard you say
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain
'Cause  I have felt the same, no
Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh,  can you see the love in mine?
She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls
Well, darlin', here we go again
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are
And I could put you back together when you come apart
And we should make a start now, oh

It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth
Why am I feelin' so nervous when
Things are goin' so perfect? And
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you

I will remember you
In the way you'd want me to
But it's hard to come to terms right now
Sunset looked today
As if it knew you'd gone away
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down
Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain
Oh, I could be a shoulder, not a burden
And it's time for me to call your son again
And say
She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away
I will remember you
With white wine by the barbecue
On New York at the birthday do, downtown
All that comes to mind
Is a memory of laughin' out loud

Welcome to the world
I heard your heart beat and lost every word
Just stood there quietly taking in the sound
Of our love
This is gonna hurt
But I'll stand beside you, for better or for worse
And I will find you whenever you're lost
I'll be right here
And ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away
Welcome to the world
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt
Don't let them change you, words are only words
Just like I loved you
And yes, you were the first
A new beginning, bright and unreserved
A beautiful red flower in the earth
Will grow, and I know

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't brеak my boat
The stones crash on the boardwalk
Thе wind rush through the trees
I keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been
Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight"
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

“Supermarket Flowers” is Ed’s tribute to his late grandmother. Using the metaphor of an angelic persona, the lyrics focus on the positive aspects and impact left behind by one who is now deceased.
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get-well-soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But, Mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it, too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you?

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

“Galway Girl” is a blend of Irish folk tradition and Ed’s signature acoustic pop style. The lyrics depict a man and woman meeting in an Irish pub and dancing and singing the night away.
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?"
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Oh, baby, I apologise for it
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history?
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mm

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a handprint on the door
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before
This is our luck, baby, running out
Our clothes were never off
We still have our roads to run about
To scale the map, to scale the map to get us back on track
I've seen you in a fight you lost
I've seen you in a fight
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
In our house made of paper, your words all over me
We're under the sheets and you're killin' me
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys, boys

Oh, oh, starry-eyed
Hip, oh, sta-a-a-a—
Oh, oh, deye-yrrats
​swolg ydobyrevE, starry-eyed
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning
Handlebars that I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in and I'll throw out my heart and get a new one
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning, ah
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And everybody glows
Oh, everybody's starry-eyed
And my body goes
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah
Woah, oh, oh, ah, ah
Woah, oh, oh
So we burst into colours, colours and carousels
Fall head first like paper planes and playground games

I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
Noises
I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathin'
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
Now you're in the world
If I was a sculptor, but, then again, no
Or a girl who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

Stripped to the waist, we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over
Yes, since we found out, since we found out
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could
After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its colour
But now I've seen it through and now I know the truth
That anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could happen, anything could happen
Anything could

We don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race
When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shinin' up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We were lovers for the first time
Running all the red lights
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah
We were sipping on emotions
Smoking and inhaling every moment
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah
We were high and we were sober
We were on and we were over
We were young and now I'm older
But I'd do it all again
Getting drunk on a train track
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes
Ten dollars was a fat stack
I'd do it all again
Bomber jacket and a snapback
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach
"Re: Stacks" on the playback
I'd do it all again
We were lovers on a wild ride
Speeding for the finish line
Come until the end of our time, yeah
Started off as a wildfire
Burning down the bridges to our empire
Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah

You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past the satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Love me like you do, l-l-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, t-t-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin
Is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both hate everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle
Swae Lee
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (
Yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me (
Woo
You can never come too close for comfort
I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn
I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover
And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber
Iced out body, didn't go to college
Price tag poppin', then you on a private
Don't say sorry, everyone's watchin'
When you're where I am, everything's timeless

Remember me in a simple way, not what I did or said
When I think of you now, I just think of the day we met
Don't forget me, like I didn't care
Yeah, I stole from myself just to make you complete
I don't think you have the patience
I don't think you know the difference
And I don't want cute imitations
I know you wanted to save me
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, but it's not enough
And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on
Would you be taking me higher?
Would we be living as liars?
I wanna know, I wanna know
When the memories pack up and leave, it will set me free
All those days on the beach will be washing away from me
I will keep you secretly just to keep the peace
Keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas

Do you remember when we moved out?
My mum said, "I love you, but it's a small house"
So we changed up and saved up
Gave up our town
We were dangerous, couldn't tame us
What's missing now?
Time (
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Suddenly, we got no time (
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
We're so busy doing life (
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
That I miss your eyes on mine, mine
If you just focus on me
Like we were sixteen
And plotting our lives
Can I wear your t-shirt and sleep
On you while I dream
Of all the good times?
When we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen
Like we were sixteen

You can worry 'bout this
You can worry 'bout that
You can worry 'bout she
You can worry 'bout this
You can worry 'bout that
You can worry 'bout she
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me
Lately, I don't think, I don't think about you, feelin' so free
Been jumpin' through hoops to get under you, but now I'm cool
Baby, you don't gotta, you don't gotta worry, worry 'bout me
Been havin' good times
Been havin' late nights, yeah
And then you call me
Ask if I'm alright, what the hell?
Sayin' that you care about me
But you just wanna be in my head 'cause you're lonely
I thought I needed you to feel safe
But now that I've been through it, I'm stuck in a good place
Ooh, why you tryna put me in a different mood?
Just because I'm still not seein' someone new?

Painted to pure perfection
We had a real connection
Bodies aching, overtaken
You kept me at a distance
Not asking any questions
Fingers pressing, learning lessons
Beautiful lies on a Friday night
Starting to wonder where we lost the magic
Head in the clouds, talking so loud, all I hear is static
I'm not a material girl
Everything in your world just feels like plastic
Wearing your crown, it's pulling me down
You just want the power
You're not really down for love
You just want the power
No, I'm not chasing paper
And I'm not faking neither
Take me higher or this will expire
Your self obsessions boring
Sorry if I'm ignoring
Mindless actions lead to destruction

Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed
I bet you're still walkin' on a tightrope
Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho
You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know
It's a thin line between all this love and hate
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place
So, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
Yeah, baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

Fire and ice
This love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I can
How long will I need you?
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan
How long will I be with you?
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand
How long will I want you?
As long as you want me to
And longer by far
How long will I hold you?
As long as your father told you
As long as you can

That feeling that doesn't go away just did
And I walked a thousand miles to prove it
And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
The colour of my blood is all I see on the rocks as you sail from me
Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me
My bones will bleach, my flesh will flee
So help my lifeless frame to breathe
And God knows I'm not dying, but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew
The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
And my blood is all I see as you steal my soul from me
Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me

“Army” is about her best friend. She described the song on Instagram:
I know that I've been messed up
You never let me give up
All the nights and the fights
And the blood and the breakups
You're always there to call up
I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid
But yeah, you understand
Yeah like no one can
I know that we don't look like much
But no one fucks it up like us
16 and you never even judged me
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me
Sitting there in the caravan
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

I used to be a rollin' stone, ya know
If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beatin' for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say, the more my work gets done
'Cause I live and breathe this
Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man, yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had
Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, an' I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom,
I love ya
Yes, I do
If you choose to, you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city
Some others choose the good old family home
I like livin' easy without family ties
'Til the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no
sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

It's a little bit funny
This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travellin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

Russel Mulcahy, video director of the videoclip, told us ‘I Want My MTV!’:
You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well, look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin', you just fade away
Don't you know, I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standin'
I'm still standin'
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hittin' somethin' that's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
solid walls of sound
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums
But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life  to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life  to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour, 9 a.m.​​
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
burnin' out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
burnin' out his fuse up here alone
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all the science, I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man

There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singin' the blues
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm goin' back to my plough
Back to the howlin' old owl in the woods
Huntin' the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

Likely inspired by the song Daddy Cool’s “Eagle Rock” and Neil Sedaka’s “Oh! Carol,” “Crocodile Rock” comments on rock’s evolution over time using metaphors.
I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you (
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (
No, no, no, no, no
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man
Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk a—
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beatin'
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
I'm walkin' down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone

Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mindfuck America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Well, maybe I'm the faggot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Say, hey, cha
Hear the sound of the fallin' rain
Comin' down like an Armageddon flame
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery"
And bleed, the company lost the war today
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
Hear the drum poundin' out of time
Another protester has crossed the line
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen?
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Fuck
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothin' and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?
I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whinin' 'cause it's bringin' her down
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh-yuh-yuh-yuh

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Do you know what's worth fightin' for
When it's not worth dyin' for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocatin'?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of Suburbia
The bible of "none of the above"
On a steady diet of
Soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my
Sins in Hell as far as I can tell
'Least the ones I got away with
And there's nothin' wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me
Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
A living room on my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
Doin' someone else's cocaine

I'm havin' trouble tryin' to sleep
I'm countin' sheep, but runnin' out
As time ticks by, still I try
No rest for cross-tops in my mind
On my own, here we go
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulgin' out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own, here we go
My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughin' in my face
A crooked spine,
my senses dulled
Past the point of delirium
On my own, here we go
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulgin' out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own, here we go

Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you been thinking about ditching me
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
Hoo

Mike Dirnt
) A small cloud has fallen, the white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
Vegging on one detail, the rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red
Picture sounds
Of moving insects, so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
Mike Dirnt
) Laying in my bed, I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
) You're standing so damn close, my body begins to swell
Why does 1 and 1 make 2?

Why does 1 and 1 make 2?

I sit around and watch the
tube
, but nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors, and I'm fuckin' lazy
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blind
And I smell like shit
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me movin'
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feelin' like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell and I lost the key
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blind
And I smell like shit

My heart is beatin' from me
I am standin' all alone
Please call me only if you are comin' home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust
What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure? What is your pain?
Do you dream too much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch?

The blue stash of men, they claimed responsibility for the executions
Described as severely mentally disturbed
It appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group
Deserve to be annihilated
I get my kicks, and I wanna start a rager
I wanna dance like I'm on the video
I got a fever for the violent behavior
I'm sweatin' bullets like a modern Romeo
Bang! Bang! Gimme fame!
Shoot me up to entertain (
Ah-ah
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed!
Give me death or gimme head (
Ah-ah
Daddy's little psycho, and Mommy's little soldier
I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live, and it's on my radio
I got my photobomb, I got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else

She, she screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with a brick of self-control
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm takin' heed just for you
She, she's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Wakin' up this time
To smash the silence with a brick of self-control
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm takin' heed just for you
Yeah

Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face, but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been
Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry ol' what's-his-face?
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face, but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
The regrets are useless in my mind
She's in my head, I must confess
The regrets are useless in my mind
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go

Dear mother, can you hear me whinin'?
It's been three whole weeks since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me tremblin'
'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feelin' so alone
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I wanna take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason, it's now feelin' like my home
And I'm never gonna go
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I wanna take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

Nobody likes you, everyone left you
They're all out without you, having fun
Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collectin' unemployment checks
A flunky only along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
"What's in love is now in debt"
On your birth certificate
So strike the fuckin' match to light this fuse, 'use
The town bishop's an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Stand still when it's do or die
You better run for your fuckin' life
It's not over 'til you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin', it's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
There is nothin' left to analyze

I text a postcard sent to you, did it go through?
Sendin' all my love to you
You are the moonlight of my life every night
Givin' all my love to you
My beatin' heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sendin' all my love to you
With every breath that I am worth here on Earth
I'm sendin' all my love to you
So if you dare to second-guess, you can rest
Assured that all my love's for you
My beatin' heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sendin' all my love to you

“Give Me Novacaine” is about Jesus of Suburbia wanting to take drugs to relieve stress from his life and asking for reassurance from his alter ego St. Jimmy.
Take away the sensation inside
Bittersweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbin' toothache of the mind
I can't take this feelin' anymore
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feelin' and that's alright
Jimmy says it's better than here
I'll tell you why
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
Oh, Novacaine

Tre Cool
St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette, he's insubordinate
Comin' at you on the count of one, two
One, two, three, four
My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your mama talked about
King of the Forty Thieves
and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment
I'm the
patron saint
of the denial
With an
angel face
and a taste for suicidal
Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city in the halo of lights
Product of war and fear that we've been victimized
I'm the
patron saint
of the denial
With an
angel face
and a taste for suicidal

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Oh my God
Ooh-ooh
Cha
Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Ah, ah
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Oh, I, I wanna watch you bleed
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed, but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, who's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Ah, ah
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Oh, I, I wanna hear you scream

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah
Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

“Don’t Cry” is a Guns N' Roses melodic ballad off their 1991 album Use Your Illusion I.
Talk to me softly, there's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
I know how you feel inside, I've, I've been there before
Something is changing inside you and don't you know?
Don't you cry tonight
I still love you, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now and please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you and the times we had, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

Ooh, ooh
Hey
Mama, take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey-hey, yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh-oh, yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, aye-hey, yeah
Ooh-oh, yeah, oh, yeah, aw
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey-hey, yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh, yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, aye-aye, yeah
Ooh

Strother Martin
What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God
and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

One, two
One, two, three, four
Guess I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind, some peace of mind that'll stay
So I thumbed it down to 6th in L.A.
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way
Police and niggas, that's right, get out of my way
Don't need to buy none of your gold chains today
Now, don't need no bracelets clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket, 'til then, won't you cut me some slack?
You're one in a million, yeah, that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you, but you were much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high, ow
Immigrants and faggots, they make no sense to me
They come to our country and think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini-Iran or spread some fucking disease
They talk so many goddamn ways, it's all Greek to me
Well, some say I'm lazy, ooh, and others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy, I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to an end, I-I keep it moving along
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

One, two
One, two, three, four
*Whistling*
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now
Said, woman, take it slow, it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
Patience
Mm, yeah
I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Just a urchin livin' under the street, I'm a
Hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line
Rags to riches, or so they say, you gotta
Keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know, it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doin' the time
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah, yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

If I say I don't need anyone, I can say these things to you, 'cause
I can turn on anyone just like I turned on you
I've got a
Tongue like a razor, a sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors, but then you'll do whatever I like
Here I am, and you're a rocket queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a rocket queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene
I've seen everything imaginable pass before these eyes
I've had everything that's tangible, honey, you'd be surprised
I'm a bisexual innuendo in this burned-out paradise
If you turn me on to anything, you better turn me on tonight
Here I am, and you're a rocket queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a rocket queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene
Cha

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

You thought that it would be okay, at first
The situation could be saved, of course
But they'd already picked out your grave and hearse
Beware the wrath of masked crusaders
Did you girlboss too close to the sun?
Did they catch you having far too much fun?
Come with me, when they see us, they'll run
Something wicked this way comes
Good thing I like my friends cancelled
I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour,
and poison thorny flowers
Welcome to my underworld where it gets quite dark
At least you know exactly who your friends are
They're the ones with matching scars
It's easy to love you when you're popular
The optics click, everyone prospers
But one single drop, you're off the roster
"Tone-deaf and hot, let's fucking off her"

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
"You remind me of a younger me," I saw potential
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, "They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign"
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
If we never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullet?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, a bullet?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay
Wouldn't put it like that
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming around
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without

Walk in your rainbow paradise
Strawberry lipstick state of mind
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Your wonder under summer skies
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

I had started to feel myself becoming someone I didn’t want to be, and that was really hard.
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you
Ooh, ooh

You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal"
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm
Matilda
, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up
You can see the world, following the seasons
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it
But I'm into it , I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your, it's none of your—"
It's New York, baby, always jacked up
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus
In a black dress,
she's such an actress

Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with it
I'm here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on my fingertips
And up to your mouth, I'm feelin' it out
I'm feelin' it now
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you t—
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that something, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are in
I mess around with him
And I'm okay with it

Coucou
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I confess
I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that
There's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?

Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Browns my skin just right
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I, I can feel it take a hold
I can feel you take control
Of who I am and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
Golden

“Sweet Creature” is about two people facing difficulties in their relationship. They take comfort in knowing they belong together despite all the arguments.
Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going
But we know where we belong
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But, oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
Sweet creature
Running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough

Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you, and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And this was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Tellin' those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimmin' in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart   beat

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Uhh, ahh
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'm radioactive, radioactive

First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second things second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age, taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few that look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain, taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold,
have a seat
In the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder
Kids were laughin' in my classes
While I was schemin' for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smilin' from the stage while
You were clappin' in the nosebleeds

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

Look out for yourself
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
My enemy-y-y-y-y
But I'm ready
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Ty Dolla $ign
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Ooh , I'm just a sucker for pain
Dolla $ign
I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog
Love and the loyalty, that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Ooh , I'm just a sucker for pain

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Will the stars align?
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for (
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems

Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
Woah
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, woah
I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive

There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it
We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today
It's gotta get easier, oh, easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today, not today
There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road was at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me
Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones
Playin' with a stick of dynamitе
There was nevеr gray in black and white
There was never wrong till there was right
Feelin' like a bould
r hurtlin'
Seein' all the vultures circlin'
Burnin' in the flames, I'm workin' in
Turnin
' in a bed, that's darkenin'

Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is ragin' against us now
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here
We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire
There's nights we had to just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time
But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

“Warriors” is a song written and recorded by American alt-rockers Imagine Dragons.
As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream
Here we are, don't turn away now (
Don't turn away
We are the warriors that built this town (
This town
Here we are, don't turn away now (
Don't turn away
We are the warriors that built this town (
This town
From dust
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love
Here we are, don't turn away now (
Don't turn away
We are the warriors that built this town (
This town
Here we are, don't turn away now (
Don't turn away
We are the warriors that built this town (
This town
From dust

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving
I take it in, but don't look down
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I coulda gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Look out for yourself
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
My enemy-y-y-y-y
But I'm ready
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Can't take the way you mistreated me (
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (
Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man

I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hmm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together? I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
Wake up and rise and shine
Best get to work on time
No more playing video games
Things are about to change
We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hmm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together? I ain't your mama

If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?
Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, bae
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue, yeah
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

“Waiting For Tonight” was originally sung by girl group 3rd Party in 1997.
Oh, yeah
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

¡Gente de Zona!
Lo mejor que suena ahora
JLo
Como en la vida, el amor es así
Nace de la nada y se convierte en todo
Nunca imaginé enamorarme así
No tenías previsto sentir amor
El amor es así
Inspirador, cautivador
Conmovedor, provocador
Y a veces tentación
El amor es así
Controlador, es dictador
Emocionante, apasionante
Depredador
Gente de Zona
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos tú y yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu corazón es testigo
Dime qué fue lo que pasó
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni tú ni yo, ni tú ni yo

Me tratas como una princesa y me das lo que pido
Tú tienes el bate y la fuerza que yo necesito
Cuando estamos solos, te juro, no me falta nada
Te pongo un trece de diez cuando estamo' en la cama
Nunca había sentido algo tan grande
Y me vuelve loca tu lado salvaje
Tú me has dado tanto que he estado pensando
Ya lo tengo todo, pero
Oscarcito
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (
Yeah, yeah
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (
Te tiene loca
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (
Yeah, yeah
¿Y el anillo pa' cuando? (
Te tiene loca
Hueles como me gusta, me besas como me gusta
Me agarras como me gusta, así, así, que a mí me gusta
Como muerde la fruta , si sale de noche, me asusta
Sin mapa conoces la ruta, así, así, que me gusta
Sigue aquí, papi, estoy pa' ti
Dale atrás, que así somos las del Bronx
Don't stop, muévete más, que siga la fiesta conmigo no más
No pierdas el enfoque, papi, tienes la clase cuando apenas la toque
Home run con tres en base

Murder Inc., haha
It must be the ass that got me like damn
If it get any fatter, man, the Rule gon' have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the L-O, hello
, no, I'm not
Lee Harvey Oswald
, I'm the Rule and a shot call
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now
Ain't that funny?
Ashanti
It's been a while since you came around
Now you wanna see what's goin' down
Tryna tell me how you want my time
Tryna tell me how I'm on your mind (
On your mind
See, it never had to be this way
You should've never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kind of lame
Knowin' how the situation change
Ashanti
Ain't that funny? (
Ain't it funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me, love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (
Ain't it funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me, love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

Estoy loca, enamorada de ti
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Dance, yes (
RedOne
Love, next
Dance, yes (
J.Lo
Love , next
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
I'm a old dirty dog all day
No way, José
Your girl only go one way, ay, mi madre
You should check that out
Maybe you won't turn her out
Maybe it's none of my business
But for now, work it out, let's get this, dale
Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside
I find it so stupid, so why should I hide
That I love to make love to you, baby?
Yeah, make love to me
So many ways, wanna touch you tonight
I'm a big girl, got no secrets this time
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby
Yeah, make love to me

Think you gotta keep me iced? You don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash? I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz? I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw the dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pullin' up your sleeve, so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raisin' up a toast, so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're ballin' out of control
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

This entire song can be taken two different ways: One, Kanye is talking about his relationship with fame . Two, he’s talking about a specific girl in his life.
Whose fault?
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure
On the bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fuckin' self
'Til about 2 a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

They used to tell me
Used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million-dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing, remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined it so much, some nights, it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots, but it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights, it felt like draft day, you know
My, my stepbrother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas, look
Think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million-dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like, "Ain't too much that's different"
I be shinin', they be shinin',
get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know 'bout wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

I found myself dreamin'
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walkin' on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone
I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief,
and I've realised
No, we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standin'
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you

It breaks my heart
They ain't believe in us
We the
Best Music
They played themselves
While you hatin' and being jealous
You could be over here embracing that love
More love, more blessings, more life
GOD DID
GOD DID
You either win with us or you watch us win
DJ Khaled
Rick Ross
They wanted us down, ooh-woah
But look at us now, oh
They counted us out (
Time to say a prayer
M-M-M—
They didn't think that we would make it, oh (
May we bow our heads
They didn't believe in us, oh (
Huh
Rick Ross
But I know God did, God did
Oh, God did (Oh-oh,
Khaled
Oh, yes, God did (Oh-oh,
Khaled
Oh, God did (
God is great
But I know God did

I got the world in my hands, the masterplan
But I don't know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don't know why I keep callin',
why I keep callin' you, hey
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now. What, huh?
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now. Huh?
I'm in my
Christian Dior
with a
Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir
Chanel
Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa
Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I'm in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar
was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik
and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I'm very single
Abbey Lee too, I'm a freak, boo
I'm wilding, I'm on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen

Hey
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
with Ariana Grande
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh-woah
Hey
Yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're past the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you've made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
Ohh
Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Everyday women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
True and livin' livin' in us,
resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say, "Stay down", and we stand up
Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up
King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up

Birds don't, birds don't, birds don't, birds don't
Lost in emotion, mama's youngest
Tryna navigate life without my compass
Some experience death and feel numbness
But not me, I felt it all and couldn't function
Seein' you that day
Tellin' you my plans but I was leavin' you that day
It was in God's hands,
Ye was at Elon's waiting to get with me
On my way to Texas, that's when Virginia hit me
And I realized in that instant
Our last conversation, you was against it
Told you I was going to Turks for Thanksgiving
I heard what I wanted to hear but didn't listen
You said you told Gene that Bup needed forgiveness
I see you went to DD's and stuffed both her fridges
You even told Dad you wished y'all never splitted
See, you were checkin' boxes, I was checkin' my mentions
Sayin' you was tired but not ready to go
Basically was dying without letting me know
I loved you met Nige, hate that he won't remember you
Two things that break my heart is what Novembers do
And T follows you, now mind you
DD calls you, Gene finds you, was that your vision?
Precision, while I'm reminiscin'
It all hits different, Ma, listen

Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Last night was the worst night
Beginning of the end
Or maybe it began before and here we go again
Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine
I don't understand, oh
There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong, oh, you always seem to blame me
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Workin' your back like, it's going out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now, girl
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
Got an obsession, of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission, so
Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
We could go all night
Give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

{*23 seconds of instrumental to open*}
They wait to plead their case, unknown cast aside
I love to see their face, can we spare the lie?
Are we afraid to see them, prisoners of history
These beautiful minds, trapped inside, bring them back to life
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Ooooooohhhhhhhhhh
Aowwwww
So dark when I see sparks, if we don't snuff 'em out
We've gotta let 'em flame, let 'em speak their name
Let 'em reach up to the clouds
Can't eat if we don't feed 'em, can't read if we don't teach 'em
There's no light if we just hide 'em
Don't just let 'em die
Let 'em shine  let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine  let 'em shine on
Oh let 'em shine on  let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine on  let 'em shine, on
Ohhhhh sparks flicker, in the distance
Lonely out in space
They sing out, but we're not listening
Cause we don't see their face
We can't let 'em die we can't, make 'em hide
All the little miracles that live inside
Let 'em shine, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh

There ain't no time
No time for sorrow
And we ain't got time no time
Ah time to be sad
And maybe the world ain't what it could be
But to understand why is to know reality
Ah don't give in
Ah I said hang on
How many times did you hear your mom and daddy?
Say oh child I never had it so good
I wanna say thank you, thank you for the start
Cause deep in my soul, I know you did all that you could
I'm just a part of your dreams this I know
But I'll do what ever possible to make this thing grow
Ah don't give in
I said hang on
Ah now say tomorrow you woke up a king
Now tell me just how would you fix everything?
You walk around complaining about how things are
But what have you added to this world so far
Check out your mind, and see what the answer is
And tell me how much did you give
Ah don't give in
I said hang on

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Me plus you
Me plus you (
One time; I'ma tell you one time
Me plus you (
One time; I'ma tell you one time
One time
One time
When I met you, girl, my heart went knock, knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop, stop
And even though it's a struggle, love is all we got
So we gon' keep, keep climbing to the mountain top
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right
And girl, you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (
Girl, I love, girl, I love you

), and I was like (

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I could take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby, take a chance, or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I don't know about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go
Tell me what you like, yeah, tell me what you don't
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don't never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I'ma make you shine bright, like you’re laying in the snow, burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind
Swaggy

As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now , you know, girl
We both know, it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, love me
As long as you love me, love me
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress , and don't cry
Oh, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take , my hand

Yeah
Young Money
Justin, rrr
Show you off
Tonight, I wanna show you off
What you got
A billion could've never bought
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya
'Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all  'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
'Cause all—

What do you mean?  Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna  say no
What do you mean?  Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do  you mean? Oh,  what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time,  what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm sayin'
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complainin'
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night
First you're up, then you’re down, and then  between
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean? Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Hoppin' on the red-eye
Hoppin' on the red-eye
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent in your route
See you when I touch down
You're my champagne
You make me pop off everywhere like confetti
I know it seems strange
I seen you last night and I miss you already
My bed is depressed
My pillow's a victim
Got me in chills while my hands are sweaty (
B-O-I
And I gotta fly out (
Hate you got me strung-out (
And I gotta fly out (
Hey
Hate you got me strung-out, oh-ooh
Only been ten hours but my sanity is gone
Hoppin' on the red-eye (
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag,
, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (
Hey
, big bag, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag,

Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this
You encourage everyone without tryin'
All of your boundaries keep me in line
God is within us, what you're always sayin'
Your energy is enough to suffice
Your intentions are obvious
Your affection's miraculous
Every promise you make, you keep
Never met nobody else like this, only angels speak like this
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips, only angels speak like this
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, la-di-da, la-di-da
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, di-da, la-da
La-di-da, da-da-di-da, di-da, da-da
Only angels speak like this

Had a dream, I was high
Holdin' on to the sky
But I heard your voice and stopped myself from fallin'
There'll be days, there'll be nights
When the stars don't align
And the sun can't even stop the rain from pourin'
So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go
'Cause all I know
This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what , no mattеr what
It's only us
Yeah, no matter what
Got you good, in the bag
Evеrything that I have
When the silence fills the air, just know I'm on it
When the waves start to crash
Like a fear from the past
Just remember that you're all I've ever wanted (
Ever wanted

Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
In the mornin' or the late
Say the word, on my way
Bona fide stallion
Ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run
Ain't on the side, you're number one
Yeah, every time I come around, you get it done
Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hundred racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah

I got my peaches out in Georgia
I get my weed from California
I took my chick up to the North, yeah
I get my light right from the source, yeah
And I say, oh
The way I breathe you in
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There's nothing like your touch
It’s the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia
I get my weed from California
I took my chick up to the North, yeah
I get my light right from the source, yeah
You ain't sure yet
But I'm for ya
All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I’m in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

Throwin' petals like, "Do you love me or not?"
Head is spinnin', and it don't know when to stop
'Cause you said, "Forever," babe, did you mean it or not?
Hold on, hold on
You leave me on read, babe, but I still get the message
Instead of a line, it's three dots, but I can connect them
And if it ain't right, babe, you know I'll respect it
But if you need time, just take your time
Honey, I get it, I get it, I get it
Way you got me all in my head
Think I'd rather you in my bed
Whatever it is, you know I can take it
I'm countin' the days, how many days 'til I can see you again?
Blowin' kisses like, "Will you catch 'em or not?"
I'm Cupid with arrows, babe, I'm just shootin' my shot, mm-mm
If I could get in, drop me a pin, hop in the— and come over
Don't wanna be friends, just skin-to-skin, I wanna get closer and closer and closer, uh
The way you got me all in my head
Think I'd rather you in my bed
Whatever it is, you know I can take it
I'm countin' the days, how many days 'til I can see you again?

Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror's staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh, I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

Timbaland
Ooh-oh

A few things, a few things, little baby, 'cause

Check it

Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Wait a minute
You ready, JT?
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Hey, going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow! Burned myself, I just had to touch it
But it's so fire, and it's all mine
Hey, baby, and we don't mind all the watchin', ha
'Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn somethin'
She ain't nothin' but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight
And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swingin' in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh
Everyone knows
all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there
Everybody says, "Say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin'"
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Chris Stapleton
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have

Get your sexy on

I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
, got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine
Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon
So keep dancin'

You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance and made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say
What you did
I already know
I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy
The bridges were burned
, now it's your turn to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day
Dance with me
Guy time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you, girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on, let's give it a whirl
See, I've been watchin' you
And I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass-shakin' thing you do
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right

Hey little mama
Ain't gotta ask me if I want to
Tell me, can I get a light?
Roll you up and let it run through my veins
'Cause I can always see the farthest stars when I'm on you
I don't wanna ever come down from this cloud of loving you
'Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
You're my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Roll me up
'Cause all I want is you, baby
One more time
Pusher girl
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
Be my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Hook me up
All I want is you, baby
You're my little pusher love girl, ain't ya?
Just my little pusher love girl

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS
Like a bitch, I would know
And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You don't really wanna stay, no
But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
’Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
I know it, I know it
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Ayy, yeah
Katy Perry, Migos, ayy
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby
Looks like you been starvin'
You got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cookin', boy
Let me take you
Under candlelight
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winnin'
lay 'em up like

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
Snoop Dogg
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees (
Yeah, yeah
, undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek
What? What? What?
At us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Snoop Dogg
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent
now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (
Ayy

Yeah, y'all know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy , your enemy
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no goin' back

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Ah, ah, ah"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard with an open heart
How did I read the stars so wrong?
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see ain't always what it seems
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete
Fallin' from cloud nine
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night,
yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

I'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you
Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

I got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
I'm tryna bathe my ape  in your Milky Way
I'm a legend, I'm irreverent, I be reverend
I be so far up-up-up-up-up, we don't give a fu-u-u**
Welcome to the danger zone, step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me a alien, a big-headed astronaut
Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
They say, "Be afraid"
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?
I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
We're far from the shallow now

I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
Mum-mum-mum-mah
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em,
let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face

Gaga talked to Grazia about writing this record saying:
Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it's free
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love, ayy
I want your drama, the touch of your hand (
Hey
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, your bad romance

Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Pay the toll to the angels
Drawing circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life
Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance,
now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night
"Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na"
In her tongue she said, "Death or love tonight"

It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital "H-I-M"
M, M, M, M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

An excerpt from a separate interview:
We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastico
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those
flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt
, yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry
, it don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I

R. Kelly
Yeah
Turn the mic up
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream
So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothin' at all
It's comin' down on me
Water like misery
It's comin' down on me

Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain on me
Mm, oh yeah, baby
Rain on me
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try, mm
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah

Sou-sour candy
I'm sour candy
So sweet, then I get a little angry
, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho
Make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jisoo
Jennie
Ask me to be nice, and then I'll do it extra mean
뜻밖의 표정 하나에 넌 당황하겠지
비싼 척이란 말들로 날 포장한 건 너야, 너야
If you wanna fix me, then let's break up here and now
거리낌 없는 눈빛에 넌 거릴 두니까
툭 까보면 어김없이 소리질러와
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you see inside, inside, inside

“Sexxx Dreams” was first debuted at Lady Gaga’s iTunes Festival set in September of 2013.
Last night
) Our lovers' quarrel
I was thinkin' about you
) Hurts more than I can say
And it was kind of dirty
) All night
And the way that you looked at me
Help me here (
It was kind of nasty, aah!
Help me here (
It was kind of trashy
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
We could be caught (
I just want this to be perfect
We're both convicted criminals of thought
'Cause I'm broken
Let's white
By the one before
Glove the bed
He was kind of nasty
Help me here (
And I feel so trashy
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads

Truth!
RedOne
Konvict
Gaga (
Oh-oh, eh
I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush
A dizzy twister dance
, can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone
What's goin' on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore (
Woo
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, a-alright
Just dance
Gonna be okay, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Spin that record, babe, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just, j-j-just dance

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

Money
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands
Hands above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary
Love

WARNING: SPOILERS FOLLOW
Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Ooouuu ooou oou
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not movin' on

Turnin' up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting to manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one
Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save 'em 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Front I've built around my oasis
Paradise is in my hands
Holdin' on so tight to this status
It's not real, but I'll try to grab it
Keep myself in beautiful places
Paradise is in my hands

I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause
Give me that thing that I love
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
Give me that thing that I love
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant,
and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days
, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh

Down on the West coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah, you
You're falling hard, I push away
, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say, "I miss you so much"
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock 'n' roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, my love

I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?
I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter
Call him up, "Come into my bedroom"
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymorе
This is the experiеnce of bein' an American whore
Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files
wasn't on
Watching
Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this

Swingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Whistlin' my name
Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here
And play a video game"
I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say, "You the bestest," lean in for a big kiss, put his favorite perfume on
"Go play your video game"
It's you, it's you, it's all for you, everything I do
I tell you all the time, Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And, baby, now you do
Mmm
Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Livin' for the fame
Kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's, this is my idea of fun
Playin' video games

One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around
Lana Del Rey
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said "I love you"
You're fun and you’re wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?

Mountain
Why? (
Got that?
Who? Me? (
Louder
Why? (
Got that?
Mountain
Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (
Louder
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Mountain
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (
Louder, alright
Choose your last words
, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

You're
good for me
Baby, you're no
good
for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want you
Diet Mountain Dew, baby,
New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Baby, put on heart-shaped
sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I been waitin' up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright
Hit me, my darling, tonight
I don't know why but I like it
Gotta get back to the wild
Give it up, give it up
Live it up, live it up

“Love” sees Lana treading her familiar themes of nostalgia for an idealized American past.
Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in lo-ove
To be young and in lo-ove
Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it
Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

Lyrics not found

I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratchin' counter tops, I was screamin'
My back arched like a cat
My position couldn't stop, you were hittin'
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it , starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it
"Eating out of the trash"
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, "When you know, you know"
And, "When you don't, you don't"
And all of the foes, and all of the friends
Have seen it before, they'll see it again
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong
But my mama told me, "It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

Her name was Kitty
Made her money being pretty and witty
They gave her the keys to this city
Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
I bought a ticket
She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
Looking back, I guess it was kismet
I waited by the stage door,
packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name,
then glowing like the end of a cigarette, wow, she came out
I said, "You're living my drеam"
Then she said to me
"Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never, ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten, so
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna"

Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign
In these stolen moments, the world is mine
There's nobody here, just us together
Keepin' me hot like July forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come late
'Cause, boy, we're gold, boy, we're gold
And I was like
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah
And a lust for life (
And a lust for life
And a lust for life (
And a lust for life
Keeps us alive (
Keeps us alive
Keeps us alive (
Keeps us alive
And a lust for life (
And a lust for life
And a lust for life (
And a lust for life
Keeps us alive (
Keeps us alive
Keeps us alive (
Keeps us alive

Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win
There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"

He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that,
he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
He used to call me poison
Like I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough

Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard?
Mosaic ceilings, painted tiles on the wall
I can't help but feel somewhat like my body marred my soul
Handmade beauty sealed up by two man-made walls
And I'm like
When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Therе's a tunnel under Ocean Boulеvard
There's a girl who sings "Hotel California"
Not because she loves the notes or sounds that sound like Florida
It's because she's in a world, preserved, only a few have found the door
It's like Camarillo, only silver mirrors, running down the corridor
Oh, man
When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?

“Carmen” is the 9th track from Lana Del Rey’s album Born to Die.
Darlin', darlin' doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling 'em she's having fun
She says, "You don't wanna be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't wanna get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin"
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning
Carmen, Carmen, stayin' up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly, how disarmin' you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream, Coney Island queen

You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

Love (
Yeah
), I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger (
Hey
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch (
Yeah
), from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil (
Hey
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries (
Hey
) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined
Love (
Yeah
), is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against ya (
Hey
And you just stay lined up, yeah
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches

It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time,
all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away,
it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to
watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Mike Shinoda
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you
Mike Shinoda
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

Should've stayed, were there signs I ignored?
Can I help you not to hurt anymore?
We saw brilliance when the world was asleep
There are things that we can have but can't keep
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well, I do
The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well, I do

I don't like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can't escape the gravity
Kiiara
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
To so much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

Your blades are sharpened with precision
Flashing your favorite point of view
I know you're waiting in the distance
Just like you always do, just like you always do
Already pullin' me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I
Let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hopin' for what I won't receive
Fallin' for the promise of the emptiness machine
The emptiness machine
Goin' around like a revolver
It's been decided how we lose
'Cause there's a fire under the altar
I keep on lyin' to, I keep on lyin' to
Already pullin' me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control, I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem
Mike Shinoda
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Mike Shinoda
Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting (
Distracting
), reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (
My own reflection
It's haunting (
It's haunting
) how I can't seem

In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

Chester Bennington
When this began
) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
I was confused
) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
Inside of me
) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
Nothing to lose
) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
Mike Shinoda
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
Chester Bennington
And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
I was confused
) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
So what am I?
) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me
Nothing to lose
) Nothin' to gain, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

“Battle Symphony” is about personal conflict, focusing on the sensation of hearing voices inside your head as if they were a symphony.
I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies
When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony
They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed but
I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin
Chester Bennington
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right
beneath my skin
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watchin' you too
Right inside your skin

I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors then rapidly
You just turn around and start askin' me
About things that you want back from me
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
Mike Shinoda
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
You'll see it's not meant to be
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head
Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you shoulda known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now you see, how quiet it is all alone

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Don't you come back no more
Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from
Pusha T
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye,
woo

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway
Just like before
Chester Bennington
& Mike Shinoda
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

It's pourin' in, you're laid on the floor again
One knock at the door and then
We both know how the story ends
You can't win if your white flag's out when the war begins
Aimin' so high but swingin' so low
Tryin' to catch fire but feelin' so cold
Hold it inside and hope it won't show
I'm sayin' it's not, but inside, I know
Today's gonna be the day you notice
'Cause I'm tired of explainin' what the joke is
This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps
bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the
Heavy is the crown
Turn to run, now look what it's become
Outnumbered, ten to one
Back thеn should've bit your tongue
'Cause thеre's no turnin' back this path once it's begun
You're already on that list
Say you don't want what you can't resist
Wavin' that sword when the pen won't miss
Watch it all fallin' apart like this

I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
But no one would listen, 'cause no one else cared
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
What am I leaving when I'm done here?
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating, I've shared what I made
I've never been perfect, but neither have you
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let somethin' shine
Goin' out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
Well, those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
'Cause honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that
green light
, I want it

Go for it
One, two
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek
They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, "Let's go out"
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Go back and tell it
Please, could you be tender?
And I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well, I guess I should go, yeah, I guess I should go
Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

Don't you think that it's
Boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again
Well, I'm bored
Because
I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasin' a million things I want
And I am
Only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showin' people how little we care
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah"
Pretty soon, I'll be getting
On my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city
Like they do in space
But my head's
Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm
Known?
And my
Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season, anyway
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing, I'm alright
It's just another graceless night
Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh-oh-oh
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

I hate the winter, can't stand the cold
I tend to cancel all the plans
But when the heat comes, something takes a hold
Can I kick it? Yeah, I can
My cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus
Forget all of thе tears that you've cried
It's ovеr
It's a new state of mind
Are you coming, my baby?
Acid green, aquamarine
The girls are dancing in the sand
And I throw my cellular device in the water
Can you reach me? No, you can't

In my head
I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

Break the news—you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe
I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I've stopped needing you

“Sober” is about “being a little bit involved with someone and it’s magic when you are out — you’re just king and queen of the weekend, you own the party.”
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
When you get to my high, when you get to
Night, midnight
Oh God, I'm clean out of air
In my lungs, it's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me
But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
We're king and queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care, but we care
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush

“Homemade Dynamite” describes the moment when you meet someone at a party and an explosive night follows.
A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally
Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome, right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Might get your friend to drive
But he can hardly see, ooh-ooh
We'll end up painted on the road, red and chrome
All the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying

A place in the city
A chair and a bed
I cover up all the mirrors
I can't see myself yet
I wear smoke like a wedding veil
Make a meal I won't eat
Step out into the street, alone in a sea
It comes over me
Oh, I'm missing you
Yeah, I'm missing you
And all the things we used to do
MDMA in the back garden, blow our pupils up
We kissed for hours straight, well, baby, what was that?
I remember saying then, "This is the best cigarette of my life"
Well, I want you just like that
Indio haze, we're in a sandstorm and it knocks me out
I didn't know then that you'd never be enough, oh
Since l was seventeen, I gave you everything
Now we wake from a dream, well, baby, what was that?
What was that?
Baby, what was that?

Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing
Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads
'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybе I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stonеd at the nail salon again
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe

During her Beats 1 Radio show about her album, Lorde said of “Sober II ”:
You asked if I was feeling it, I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning when I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home, but who am I?
Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses
We told you this was melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish is melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
And the terror and the horror
When we wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
And the terror and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
All the glamour and the trauma
And the fuckin' melodrama, whoa, whoa
All the gun fights and the lime lights
And the holy sick divine nights, whoa
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kiss and kill each other, whoa
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other, whoa

We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you
Till the veins run red and blue?
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow but we're brave
I love these roads where the houses don't change
Where we can talk like there's something to say
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

I've seen the devil
Down Sunset
In every place
In every face
Yeah
Yeah
Tell me, do you see her?  She's livin' her life
Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight
But if you knew her , she lives a lie
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised
Oh, I know what she needs
She just want the fame, I know what shе fiends
Give hеr a little taste, runnin' back to me
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh
Ooh, every night , she prays to the sky
Flashin' lights is all she ever wants to see
Beggin' on her knees to be popular
That's her dream, to be popular
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular
Just to be popular
Everybody scream 'cause she popular
She mainstream 'cause she popular
Never be free 'cause she popular

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, "Te amo"
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest
Then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie
But I don't let them play
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

Move to the music
I'm gonna find new drive
Damn, they work me so damn hard
Work by nine
Then off past five
And they work my nerves
That's why I cannot sleep at night (
You know you can do it

Strike a pose
Strike a pose

Vogue
Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor
And here's what it's for, so
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow
You know you can do it

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open
Mmm-mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm-mmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm-mmm, give yourself to me
Mmm-mmm, you hold the key
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you, my heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen, when your heart's not open
Mmm-mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm-mmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm-mmm, give yourself to me
Mmm-mmm, you hold the key

I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new, hoo
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
next to mine
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fadin' fast
Been savin' it all for you cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

And you can dance
For inspiration
Come on
I'm waiting
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I want to dance with someone else

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
"You remind me of a younger me," I saw potential
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, "They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign"
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé
I'll be your father figure,
I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets

I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it
"Eating out of the trash"
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, "When you know, you know"
And, "When you don't, you don't"
And all of the foes, and all of the friends
Have seen it before, they'll see it again
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong
But my mama told me, "It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

(
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch
We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping, make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinkin' and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissin' anybody that's around us
I just wanna have fun tonight (
Blow up this shit tonight
Put me under the flashin' light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight (
Gonna blow up
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want

And I woke up in Medellín (
¿Te gusta?
The sun was caressing my skin (
Dime
Another me could now begin (
Woo
Tranquila, baby, yo te apoyo
No hay que hablarnos mucho para entrar en rollo
Si quieres ser mi reina pues yo te corono
Y pa' que te sientes aquí tengo un trono
Te gusta cabalgar, eso está claro
Si sientes que voy rápido le bajo
Discúlpame, yo sé que eres Madonna
Pero te voy a demostrar cómo este perro te enamora

Hey, Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
Do you like to boogie-woogie?
Do you like to boogie-woogie?
Do you like to boogie-woogie?
Do you like my acid rock?
Hey, Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy
Music, music, music, music
Music, music, music, music, music
Music makes the people come together
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel
Don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie
It's like ridin' on the wind and it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in, got to have it every day

I'm outta time, and all I got is four minutes
Fikki-fikki, four minutes, ay

I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll, uh, uh
Ah, well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, uh, mm
I want somebody to speed it up for me, then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?
Fikki-fikki, fikki-fikki, come on

Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe, please
Papa, don't preach
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach
, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, mm
He says that he's going to marry me
And we can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feelin' low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old, o-old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
A-a-all we need is somebody to lean on

Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee give in
What can I do to get the money?
We ain't got the money, we ain't getting out
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearing thin
All I need's relief
I need, I need some sympathy, yeah
Look at me

We could never get free
I just wanna be
Look at me

We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream
All of my life been wading in
Water so deep, now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long, how long 'til we have a friend?
Coming down, feeling like a battery hen
Waves won't break 'til the tide comes in
What will I do in the sunrise?
What will I do without my dreams?

Onazo, yeah
Onazo
They told me everybody's 15 minutes in a different timezone
And since I have it at the moment, you the one I wanna shine my light on
Get your life, get your life, little mama, won't you get your life on?
Ain't nothing cooler than the wrong moves, when you do 'em to the right song, the right song
Let's shoot this movie and put the shit on repeat
I hope this Mary's not making you fall asleep
Before we hit the road, put our phones on silent
Nobody's tryna bring sand to the beach
What would it take to change your plans for the weekend?
'Cause I am tryna kick it like EA
The whole thing, the pre-party, the pre-sex
Now we hit the Major League where the G's at

Baby I'm yours, baby I'm yours
Love don't come easy at all
I miss you so much, I miss you so much
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, ooh, whoa
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon, we'll be together
He was a dreamer at heart
Chasing the stars, chasing the stars
Wings spread to the sun
I miss you so much, I miss you so much
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart break, ooh, whoa

The fifth track off Major’s third album Peace Is the Mission. According to Diplo
Oh, my, my, my, what you do to me?
Like lightning when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heaven and stars above
Oh, lord, have mercy, I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained, I need love
You charge me up like electricity
Jump-start my heart with your love
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful

Goddamn coward! Get your ass out of that trench!
Move, move, move, move, move!
Get out of here! Oh, fuck!
We're all fucking trapped here, we're all fucking trapped here!
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman, he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your
master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

New blood joins this earth and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time, the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow onto his own, that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

Make his fight, on the hill, in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run, through the endless grey
On they fight, for they’re right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive, through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone, except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Slaves, Hebrews born to serve to the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word, live in fear
Faith of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait, something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written, so let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
To kill the first-born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now, let my people go,
land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long, hail to fire
So let it be written, so let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
To kill the first-born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Metallica’s gut-wrenching “Ride The Lightning” is about spending your final moments in an electric chair. The title was taken from Stephen King’s The Stand.
Guilty as charged, but damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say, "I'll take your life from you"?
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold, as I watch death unfold
Consciousness, my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire, ooh
Yeah
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em man, white-knuckle tight
Through black and white
Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire
Yeah

Hey , I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey , I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They , they betray
I'm your only true friend now
They , they'll betray
I'm forever there
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
Sad but true
You , you're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You , you're my mask
You're the one who's blamed
Do , do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do , do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

Halls of justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay,
nothing can save you
Justice is lost,
justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real
Apathy their stepping stone,
so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity,
so deceiving
Through your eyes, their light burns,
hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

Blackened is the end, winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth, never a rebirth
Evolution's end, never will it mend
Never
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of Earth, terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill, nothing left to kill
Never seen before, breathing nevermore
Never
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blackened

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves, and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend, and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"?
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

And the road becomes my bride
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah
Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah
And the Earth becomes my throne
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one
And my ties are severed clean
The less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign

Lay beside me
And tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear
To make my demons run
The door is locked now
But it's opened if you're true
If you can understand the me
Then I can understand the you
Lay beside me
Under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night
We share this paralyze
The door cracks open
But there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still
But there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery

By the last breath, the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now, you've got some company
Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah, yeah
You've been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confession now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

Late at night, all systems go, you've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it, oh, so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
with your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell, and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said, "Stand and deliver, or the devil, he may take you"
, yeah
I took all of his money, and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me, no, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy
Musha ring um a do um a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Bein' drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' money with me, but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven, yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols, and I shot him with both barrels, yeah
Musha ring um a do um a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah-heh, whiskey in the jar-o

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene, uh
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one?
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one, uh
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do," uh
"And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" , hey
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Uh, she says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and for forty nights,
the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
She told my baby we danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

Ow!
Cha!
Shoo-ca-choo-ca!
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Ooh
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over
You're too low to get under
You're stuck in the middle
And the pain is thunder
It's too high to get over
You're too low to get under
You're stuck in the middle
And the pain is thunder
I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever, but nothin' he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

Think about, um, the generations, and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and children's children so that they, they, they s— they know it's a better world for them. Think they can make it a better place
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
*overlapping voices*
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang, bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
*** me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, **** me,
don't you, "Black or white" me

Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin'

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard,
a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

Why?
Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say why , why
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
If they say why , why
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it , beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Show them how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it , just beat it
Just beat it , just beat it
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Stevie Wonder
There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
James Ingram
Tina Turner
We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth,
you know
Love is all we need
Diana Ross
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true, we'll make a better day
Just you and me
Al Jarreau
Well, send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand

Siedah Garrett
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on,
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you
Siedah Garrett
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you
Siedah Garrett
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (
), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do" (
I do
This thing can't go wrong
, this feeling's so strong
Well
my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

Ah, your butt is mine, gon' tell you right, ah
Just show your face in broad daylight, ah
I'm tellin' you on who I feel, ah
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone, ah, shamone
Lay it on me, ah, alright
Ah, I'm givin' you on count to three, ah
To show your stuff or let it be, ah
I'm tellin' you, just watch your mouth, ah
I know your game, hah, what you're about, ah
Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me, that's really true, ah
But my friend, you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone
You know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?

Another massive hit from Bad, this track got to number one in the US.
Hee-hee, ooh
Go on, girl, aaow!
Hee
Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me, baby, and tell me twice
That you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
Uh, uh
I like this feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

You'll never make me stay, so take your weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time, you won't seduce me
She's saying "That's okay, hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back", she trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

Culkin
What?
But dad, this is the best part!
No!
Dad, this is the best part, come on
No, this is the—, I wanna listen to it, okay?
Right, too late? Sure, eat this
Aaow!
Aaow!
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, "I ain't second to none"

Haha, I don't know
Bet you wanna try
Every time you see, hahaha
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember
Back in the fall?
We'd be together
All day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands?
In each other's eyes
We'd stare , tell me
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Janet Jackson
Hoo!
No!
Hoo! Hee!
Hoo
Ah, tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgustin'
So what does it mean? Damn it
Kickin' me down
I got to get up, ah
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it
Hee, hoo-hoo
Michael Jackson
Peek in the shadow (
Hoo-hoo!
I come into the light (
Hee-hee!
If you tell me I'm wrong (
Hee-hee!
Then you better prove you're right
And you're sellin' out souls
But I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?
Every day, I sit and ask myself "How did love slip away?"
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin

Ah, I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me
She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah
I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said like it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

Got to be there
Got to be there in the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there
Got to be there, bring her good times
And show her that she's my girl
Oh, what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know she loves me
'Cause when I look in her eyes, I realize
I need her sharing her world beside me
So I've got to be there
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she's my girl
When she says, "Hello, world!"
I need her sharing the world beside me
That's why I've got to be there
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me
She's home
Yeah

You know, I was, I was wondering, you know
If you could keep on because
The force has got a lot of power and it
It make me feel like a
It, it make me feel like, woo!
Lovely is the feeling now
Fever, temperature's rising now
Power is the force, the vow
That makes it happen
It asks no questions why, ooh
So get closer to my body now
Just love me 'til ya don't know how, ooh
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love
I wanna rock with you
Dance you into day
I wanna rock with you
We're gonna rock the night away
Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

What about sunrise? What about rain?
What about all the things that you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields? Is there a time?
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine?
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh
What have we've done to the world? Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields? Is there a time?
What about all the dreams that you said was yours and mine?
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

Invincible.
Michael Jackson
Got-t-t-t me, that girl
Oh, man! Look at that girl right there!
Goodness gracious! Uh! That girl's fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine, too!
She is banging!
Ooh, she's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Ah-uh-uh-uh-uh, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
Pfft, You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl

I can get her
All right!
Shamone, then, shamone
Watch
I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that
I, I, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk, the way I talk
I cannot explain
The things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
So stay with me, fulfill my dreams
I'll be all you'll need

Da de-de-da de-de-da
Da de-de de-da, lda de-da-dum
Da de -de -de -da, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Butterflies inside
All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my call
When I'm tryna get through
Keep me wonderin' why when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
'Cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it
'Cause baby, every time I love you
In and out my life, in, out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, in, out, baby
So baby, yes, love never felt so good
Baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd die if it's never mine, not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so good
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me

We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A

The truth is bulletproof, there's no foolin' you
I don't dress the same
Me and who you say I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
'Cause that's for chasin' cars
Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts
And goin' way too far
I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'causе I
used to be young
Take onе, pour it out, it's not worth cryin' 'bout
The things you can't erase
Like tattoos and regrets,
words I never meant
And ones that got away
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
And took another road
Turns out crowded rooms empty out as soon
There's somewhere else to go, oh-oh

It's our party, we can do what we want (
Ear Drummers
, ooh)
It's our party, we can say what we want (
Mike WILL Made-It
, ooh)
It's our party, we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want
It's our party, we can do what we want
It's our party, we can say what we want
It's our party, we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want, we can screw who we want (
Right about now
, ayy)
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "hell no"?
'Cause we gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party
Dancin' with Molly
Doin' whatever we want
This is our house, this is our rules

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away

La, la, la-la, la
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes
Forever and ever, no more
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
La, la, la-la, la

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name,
only "baby"
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
Close your eyes

I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
"You'll never reach it"
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost with no direction
My faith is shaken
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

“Adore You” opens Miley Cyrus' Bangerz on a soft note, giving no hint to the chaos to come.
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Hey
Oh, oh, mm
Baby, baby, yeah
Are you listenin'?
Wonderin' where you've been
All my life
I just started livin'
Ooh, oh, baby

And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm cryin' out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me, uh
I feel like I'm standin' with an army
Of men armed with weapons
Hey, oh

It’s a strong and direct statement of Cyrus’s political commitment to feminism and LGBTQ+ movements,
Hallelujah, I'm a freak, I'm a freak, hallelujah
Every day of the week, I'ma do ya like I want to
I'm a Nile crocodile, a piranha
Oh my God, she got the power
Oh, look at her, she got the power
So, so, so
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty
, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Hallelujah, I'm a witch, I'm a witch, hallelujah
Swish swish, I'm a three-point shooter, I blow through ya
Like a hot wind out in the bayou, yah

Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Miley Cyrus
Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (
I can't control it
I try to replace it with city lights
I'll never escape it, I need the high
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it
You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Miley Cyrus
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

Mmm, mmm, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Ooh, yeah
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
It's been months
And for some reason I just
And I'm stronger than this, yeah
No more walking 'round with my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough to get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah (
Mr. Worldwide
), oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life (
Ne-yo
), hey, hey, hey
Let's get it now
This the last twenty dollars I got
But I'ma have a good time ballin' tonight
Tell the bartender, "Line up some shots"
'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
And told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk , dirty dance
She a freaky girl  and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, "Wanna ride out?" And she said, "Yes"
We didn't go to church but I got blessed

You, yeah, you, you
You, yeah, you, you
You, yeah, you, you, you
Ooh, it's something about
I can't figure it out
It's something about her
Said, ooh, it's something about
Kind of woman that want you, but don't need you
Hey, I can't figure it out
It's something about her
'Cause she walk like a boss, talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss, do what a boss do
She got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kinda girl I need, oh
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Won't you come and spend a little time?
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Ooh, the way you shine
Miss independent

The single started radio play the week of February 4, 2007.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
Hmm
Want to, but I can't help it, I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move, but I like it
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
And it's all because
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

What's up with that rabbit? What's up with that rabbit?
She good with it, she good with that ass all over my carrot
Took her straight to Paris, puss before the karat
Soon as I pull it down, I swear they wanna get married
Damn, goddamn, I swear these girls, goddamn
Damn, damn, I swear, my nigga, goddamn
First, they start off bougie, then I'm like, "Is that yo booty?"
Then she let me touch her, now we fucking
She knows, she knows
She knows, she knows
She knows, I been waiting just to take her down
Oh, yeah
I told my partner, "Ne-Yo , hit me when she come around
And I'ma tear that body up"
A-A-Anytime she walk in, she tear the party up
Time and time, time again, any city, any club
She know what's up , she know she dope
Body like drugs and I need another dose
Baby putting on a show
No matter how much she do, I want some more
She got class with that ass when she hit the floor
She knows, oh, yeah, that's for sure

Woah-oh, woah
Woah-oh, woah
Mmm, she's starin' at me
I'm sittin' wonderin' what she's thinking
Mmm, nobody's talkin'
'Cause talkin' just turns into screamin', oh
And now as I'm yellin' over her, she yellin' over me
All that that means is neither of us are listening
And what's even worse, that we don't
Even remember why we're fighting
So both of us are mad for nothing
Nothing
Nothing
But we won't let it go for nothing
Nothing, it should be nothing
To a love like what we got
Oh, baby I know sometimes it's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now?
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
And I don't want you to go to bed
No, I don't wanna go to bed
And I don't want you to go to bed
Oh, no, no, no

Yeah, uh-huh!
Your boy Juicy J
She bad, yeah

Early morning breakfast and head
And I got Tina, Tasha and Toya, I call ‘em the triple threat
All them bitches be soaking wet
This the first night them bitches met
You know from the moment she turn around
She know how to back it up and drop it down
She know she what all the fellas looking at
Cause they know soon as her song come on it's a wrap
And she loves the attention
That she get when she moves, yeah
Showin' out with her home girls
Hypnotizing all the dudes, oh

Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido, yeah
Hey, yay
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

The first single from In Utero, “Heart-Shaped Box” details the battle of wills inherent to a new relationship when one doesn’t quite feel so strongly about another person.
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your highness, I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey, wait, I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to've met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours
I like you
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything about a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids
Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours
I like you
You, you, you
You, you
Ahh!

I'm so happy, 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
Broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is every day, for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze, 'cause I've found God
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there
And I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good

Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blowtorch
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

Rape me
Rape me, my friend
Rape me
Rape me again
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one
Hate me
Do it, and do it again
Waste me
Rape me, my friend
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one, ah
I'm not the only one
My favorite inside source
I'll kiss your open sores
Appreciate your concern
You're gonna stink and burn

Underneath the bridge, tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped have all become my pets
And I'm livin' off of grass and the drippings from the ceilin'
It's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any feelings
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm

Cobain’s lyrics poke fun at the people outside of the underground music scene that began showing up at Nirvana shows after the release of the group’s debut album, Bleach.
Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs, and he
Likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs,
and he
Likes to sing along
and he
likes to shoot his gun
, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say, "Yeah"
We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs, and he
Likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means, and I say
He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
, and he
Likes to sing along
and he
likes to shoot his gun,
but he
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means,
and I say, "Yeah"

I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do, think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free
I'm standin' in your line
I do, hope you have the time
I do, pick a number too
I do, keep a date with you
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free

We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago
Oh, no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

What else should I be?
All apologies
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
What else could I write?
I don't have the right
What else should I be?
All apologies
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married
Buried
I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything's my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua sea foam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn
Chokin' on the ashes of her enemy

Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Tradin' off and takin' turns
I don't regret a thing
And I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you
Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowin' fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fightin' jealousy
Until it's fucking gone
I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you

Kurt Cobain
Come on, people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Mmm
When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Never met a wise man
If so, it's a woman
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you

This is a cover of “In The Pines” by American folk and blues singer, songwriter and guitar virtuoso Lead Belly, who Kurt Cobain describes as his “favorite performer” while introducing the song.
Krist Novoselic
Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening
What is it?
This was written by (
Uh, what?
) my favorite performer. Our favorite performer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
Oh! And there's a donation basket. Kurt wants to buy Lead Belly's guitar
Oh yeah, this guy representing the Lead Belly estate wants to sell me Lead Belly's guitar for five hundred thousand dollars
We're passing a basket if anyone-
Yeah, I even asked David Ges— Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me and he wouldn't do it. Okay
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm havin' fun
I think I'm dumb
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
My heart is broke, but I have some glue
Help me inhale
and mend it with you
We'll float around and hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
And have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothin' burn, wake me up

I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, 'fraid, ghost
Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three
She said , she said
She said , she said
She said , she said
She said , she said
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, 'fraid, ghost

I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic royalty
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally
I'm so tired, I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic royalty
I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids

“You Know You’re Right,” recorded in January of 1994, was the last song Nirvana finished as a group.
I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
And always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
Hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
Steaming soup against her mouth
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love herself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
Always knew it'd come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold
If she floats then she is not
A witch like we've thought
A down payment on another
One at Salem's lot
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants
That legendary divorce is such a bore
As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead, I had a dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before

Hey, hey
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Oh, oh
) I'm doin' this tonight
You're
) Probably gonna start a fight
) Know this can't be right
Hey, baby, come on
) Loved you endlessly
And
) You weren't there for me
) Now, it's time to leave
And make it alone
Justin Timberlake
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby,
bye, bye, bye
Justin Timberlake
J.C. Chasez
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me, but it
ain't no lie
Baby
, bye, bye, bye
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
Might sound crazy, but it
ain't no lie
Baby
, bye, bye, bye (
Oh, oh

It's some kind of love, it's some kind of fire
I'm already up, but you lift me higher
You know I'm not wrong, you know I'm not lyin'
We do it better, yeah, we do it better, yeah
I don't mind if the world spins faster
The music's louder, the waves get stronger
I don't mind if the world spins faster
Faster, faster
Just let me take you to a better place
I'm gonna make you kiss the sky tonight
Yeah, if you let me show the way
I'm so excited to see you excited
I'll take you to a better place, yoo-hoo
And, baby, you can love me on the way
We're flyin' up to outer space
I'm so excited to see you excited, yeah
Yeah, ooh, oh
J.C. Chasez
You like the bass down low, I wanna lose control
I wanna dance all night, you like it nice and slow
Don't want it any other way, tell all your friends you're gonna stay
When we're together, you know that we do it better

Ooh, yeah
You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in “no man, no cry”
Maybe that's why
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what? It's gonna be me
J.C. Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick & Justin Timberlake
You've got no choice, babe
But to move on and you know
There ain't no time to waste
You're just
too blind  to see
But in the end, you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me
why

“Tearin' Up My Heart” was on *NSYNC’s self-titled debut album.
Justin
It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you (
Hey yeah
with Chris
Baby, I don't understand
Just why we can't be lovers
Things are getting out of hand
Tryin' too much, but
baby, we can win
with Chris
Let it go
If you want me,
girl, let me know
I am
down on my knees
I can't take it anymore
It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it, too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you
Oh, alright

Merry Christmas
Happy holidays
Merry Christmas
(Hey, yeah
, oh-oh-oh)
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Happy holidays
Ooh, yeah
with All
We've been waiting
All year for this night
And the snow is glistening on the trees outside
And all the stockings
Are hung by the
fireside
Waiting for Santa to arrive
And all the love will show
'Cause everybody knows
It's Christmas time and
All the kids will see
The gifts under the tree
It's the best time of year for the family

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were actin' so strange, mm
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change
Was it somethin' I said
To make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold?
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now
Justin
I've been sittin' here
Can't get you off my mind (
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishin' I could touch your face (
Touch your face
But the truth remains, you're

Dirty pop
with JC
Sick and tired of hearin' all these people talk about
"What's the deal with this pop life?
And when is it gonna fade out?"
The thing you got to realize what we're doin' is not a trend
We got the gift of
melody
We're gonna bring it 'til the end
Come on now
It doesn't matter
'Bout the car I drive or what I wear around my neck
All that matters
Is that you recognize that it's just about respect
It doesn't matter
'Bout the clothes I wear, and where I go, and why
All that matters
Is that you get hyped and we'll do it to you every time
Come on now
Do you ever wonder why
This music gets you high?
It takes you on a ride
Feel it when your body starts to rock (
When your body starts to rock
Baby, you can't stop (
You can't stop
And the music's all you got (
Come on now
Pop

N Sync was already super popular in Germany because of this single in 1996. Two years later, it gained some traction in the U.S. and led to the phenomenon of this boyband.
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what to do now
'Cause
Lance:
Joey:
Justin:
JC:
Chris:
All:
I want you back
It's hard to say I'm sorry
It's hard to make the things I did undone
A lesson I've learned too well for sure
So don't hang up the phone now
I'm tryna figure out just what to do
I'm goin' crazy without you
Justin
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed (
Yeah
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back

I was hangin' with the fellas
Saw you with your new boyfriend, it made me jealous
I was hopin' that I'd never see you with him
But it's all good, 'cause I'm glad that I met him
Heh
'Cause now I know the competition's very slim to none
And I can tell by lookin' that he's not the one
He's not the type you said you liked
His style is wack, clothes are bad
Come on, girl, let him go
I want you back
Call me a
hater
if you
want to
But I only hate on him 'cause I want you
Say I'm
trippin'
if you
feel like
But you without me ain't right
You can say I'm
crazy,
if you
want to
That's true--
I'm crazy 'bout you
You could say I'm breakin' down inside (
Inside
'Cause I can't see you with another guy
It makes me ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him
Oh, it makes me ill
To see you give
Love and attention at his will
And you can't imagine how it makes me feel
To see you with him

Oh, oh
When the visions around you
Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you
Are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength
I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call
Was standing there all along
Justin
And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Til' the day my life is through
This I promise you
This I promise you
I've loved you forever
In lifetimes before
And I promise you never
Will you hurt anymore

You know, you have to be free in this world
You have to glow, you gotta drip, you gotta, like, express yourself, you know?
But you can't do that when you give everybody your power
They'll do whatever they want with you
You know, you can't do that
Ernähr' mich von Glyphosat und UVA
Lass' mich berieseln von dem Größenwahn
Was nicht schön ist, wird schön gesagt
Pflanze auf Beton, ich komm' im Garten an
Ich versicher' meine Artefakte
Bin gespannt, welches der viralen TikToks später im Museum landet
Bleibt die Seele odеr nur die Maske?
Ist es Kunst und ist еs das dann nur, wenn es als Kunst verpackt ist?
Stell mir 'ne Selbstdiagnose: ADHS
Gib mir alles, aber nimm mir nicht das Handy weg
Wie viele Talkshows muss ich schau'n, bis ich die Welt verstanden hab'?
Das lyrische Ich frisst sich am liebsten an Dystopien satt
Gib mir das Mic gib mir den Raum, gib mir die Aufmerksamkeit
Gib mir das High, gib mir das Low, ich hab' nicht mehr viel Zeit
Gib mir den Schlüssel aus der Matrix, ich will alles draußen seh'n
Alles, damit ich die Zeit nach mir überleb'

If you're lookin' for perfect, well, I ain't
Sometimes a sinner more than saint
Seems like I spend most my time
In the gray between the black and white
Fly with angels, run with demons
Some days I'm just breakin' even
Just 'cause I'm not the Sunday mornin' crowd
Don't mean that I'm more lost than found
And, oh-oh-oh
It might sound a little crazy
But, oh-oh-oh
God talks to me
I heard Him in momma's prayers back when I didn't care
He was tellin' me He was right there
And He spoke through the sound of the crash with that metal and glass
Sayin', "Son, you're goin' way too fast"
You might not believe
But God talks to me
Yeah, God talks to me

Yeah
Kid Ace on this bitch, so I know he fuckin' with it
Yeah
In the trap, got flavors, pick and choose, yeah, we got options
Money stuffed up in these 'Miris sloppy, 20K off rhymin'
Ain't worried about no bitch, I be in that mode, locked in, grindin'
I fucked up the streets, put a chokehold on the trap, gettin' them boxes in
I stayed down for this
Shinin' with the lights off, all my jewelry lit
'Lenci shoes cost a couple racks, I'm walkin' on your rent
I don't fuck with niggas, these niggas might tell, I don't need no codefendant
Paper keep on pilin' up, they wonderin' how I ran it up
Every time, I lost it, I shook back, it's the hustle in me
He got it all, look, he lost it, every box came in, I offed it
Fresh to death, ain't in no coffin
Gelato smokin' got me coughin'
Jewelry wet as hell, look like I came straight out the faucet
Too much money I be gettin', I feel like the feds watchin'
Better watch who you keep 'round you, niggas tell on everybody
I took risks and I got rich, in the trap stackin' my profit
Really get it in, lately I been boxed in, feel like Roddy
Juggin' turkey bags, really havin', you think I move bricks
Got several spots, two hundred gone one day, I got the trap lit
Still made it far, ain't never graduate, got more money than the teachers
Slammin' 'bows off in the trap, gettin' it off quick, nigga, I can teach you, yeah

I was born my mother's son
When I hit the ground, I was on the run
All my life, I've played the fool
I've been breakin' hearts and breakin' rules
I can't change my evil ways
You can't change my evil ways
No matter what the good book says
I can't change my evil ways no more, no more
Evil ways
My evil ways
Evil ways
I've been accused of hit and run
But all the same, I had my fun
Don't turn your back when I'm with you
'Cause I'll steal your chickens and your sister too
I can't change my evil ways
You can't change my evil ways
No matter what the good book says
I can't change my evil ways no more, no more
Evil ways
My evil ways
Evil ways
My evil ways

Oh oh oh oh
Oh ooh
When the visions around you
Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you
Are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength
I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call
Was standing there all along

And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
'Til the day my life is through

Give you my heart

Forever has now begun

Okay, baby what's it gon' take for you to be my lady?
(Tell me right now
I hear your friends tell you should, your parents tell you it's good
Your lil' sister keep yelling, "Nelly, I wish you would"
But you're hesitating, debating whether or not it's real
I ain't shooting game, boo, I'm just telling you how I feel
I'm digging everything about you, your hips and the way they sway
I hate to see you leave boo, but love to see ya walk away

Can this be true?
Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete
I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
with Chris
I never thought that love could feel like this
And then you change my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? It's a miracle
Justin
Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret
that I
never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you (
A little more time
Yes he did, baby

Justin
Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?
You know I like you, right?
But would you be my girlfriend?
Listen
I don't know why you care (
Why you thinkin' 'bout him, mama?
He doesn't even know you're there (
He ain't even paying attention
No no
'Cause he don't love your eyes (
Nah
And he don't love your smile (
Nah
Girl, you know that ain't fair (
C'mon
Justin
In the middle of the night (
Mmh
Is he gonna be by your side? (
No no
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know 'cause things ain't clear
And baby, when you cry
Is he gonna stand by your side?
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea

A super conceptual song about paranoia surrounding the rapture occurring upon the turnover to the year 2000, awkwardly combined with Texan-like space travel talk.
Riprock, AG, come in, over
Yo, turn me up, I wanna be heard
And the future looks bright
'Specially when we rip it in half
with *NSYNC
Here it comes, millennium
And everybody's talkin' 'bout Jerusalem
Is this the beginning or beginning of the end?
Well I've got other thoughts, my friend
See,
And if you're in the mood to take
Then strap on a suit and get
If you wanna fly
Come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
If you wanna fly
Come and take a ride
Take a space ride with the cowboy, baby
Why-yi-yi, yippie-yi-yay, yippie-yi-yo, yippie-yi-yay
Why-yi-yi, yippie-yi-yay, yippie-yi-yo, yippie-yi-yo
Why-yi-yi, yippie-yi-yay, yippie-yi-yo, yippie-yi-yay
Why-yi-yi, yippie-yi-yay, yippie-yi-yo, yippie-yi-yo

Oh oh oh oh
Cuando sientas tristeza
Que no puedas calmar
Cuando haya un vacío
Que no puedas llenar
Te abrazaré
Te haré olvidar
Lo que te hizo sufrir
No vas a caer
Justin
Si siente un frío tu corazón
Seré tu abrigo, tu ilusión
Hasta ya no respirar
Yo te voy a amar
Yo te voy a amar
Yo siempre te he amado
Y, amor, yo estaré
Por siempre a tu lado
Nunca me alejaré
Prometo mi amor
Te juro ante Dios
Nunca te voy a faltar
Tu corazón

This instrumentalmay sound familiar to you.
It was featured in the episode “New Kids on the Blecch” of the hit TV show The Simpsons.
Check out the making of that episode here:
Baby, you're not the only one
Oh, ooh ooh
Oh yeah, yeah
Hey yeah
I see the things he does to you
All the pain that he puts you through
And I see what's really going on
Staying out at night while you're by the phone
with Justin
Take it from me
It's a lesson to be learned
Even the good guys get burned
Take it from me
See I would give you love
Baby, you're not the only one
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love
And I know that you've hurt in the past
But if you want it, here's my heart
No strings attached

I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that?
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching?
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
Watching reruns of
Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu?  Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

I have nightmares each week 'bout that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
But I hold onto every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough
And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong
The arguments that I've won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone, and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

Lacy, oh Lacy, skin like puff pastry
Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell?
Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies
Did I ever tell you that I’m not doin' well?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time
Watching, hidden in plain sight
And ooh, I try, I try, I try
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere
The sweetest torture one could bear
Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin’ it lately
I feel your compliments likе bullets on skin
Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnatе
Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots
You got the one thing that I want
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
Try to rationalize, people are people
But it's like you're made of angel dust

One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?
I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

I am light as a feather, I'm as stiff as a board
I pay attention to things that most people ignore
And I'm alright with the movies
That make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty, that's for sure
And I am built like a mother and a total machine
I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean
And I make light of the darkness
I've got sun in my motherfuckin' pocket, best believe
Yeah, you know me, I
Forgive, and I forget
I know my age and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American
I am light as a feather, I'm as fresh as the air
Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair
I got class and integrity
Just like a goddamn Kennedy, I swear
With love to spare, I
Forgive and I forget
I know my age and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American bitch

I want it to be, like, messy
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody
The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wondеr if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again
All the things I did
Just so I could call you minе
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care
I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me
Started followin' me
And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos, I can't stand it
Oh God, I sound crazy

Cat got my tongue
And I don't think I get along with anyone
Blood runnin' cold
I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke
And I hate all my clothes
Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones
So I guess I should go
The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know
I know, I know
I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside, it's social suicide
It's social suicide, wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
Ah, ah, ah
I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy
Sеarchin' "how to start a conversation?" on a website
I talkеd to this hot guy, swore I was his type
Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like, the whole night
Everything I do is tragic
Every guy I like is gay
The morning after I panic
Oh, God, what did I say?

Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done
Another thing I ruined I used to do for fun
Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
Another conversation with nothing good to say
I thought it, so I said it, took it 'cause I can
Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign
Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Makin' the bed
And every night, I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
Where I'm drivin' through the city and the brakes go out on me
I can't stop at the red light, I can't swerve off the road
I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery, and I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined

Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff
'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand

Hey
Haven't heard from you in a couple of months
But I'm out right now and I'm all fucked up
And you're callin' my phone, you're all alone
And I'm sensing some undertone
And I'm right here with all my friends
But you're sending me your new address
And I know we're done, I know we're through
But, God, when I look at you
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts
Like blah-blah-blah
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine

Master manipulator
God, you're so good at what you do
Come for me like a savior
And I'd put myself through hell for you
Hear all the rumors lately
That you always denied
And I fell for you like water
Falls from the February sky
But now the current's stronger
No, I couldn't get out if I tried
But you convinced me, baby
It was all in my mind
And now you got me thinkin'
Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changing you is possible
No, love is never logical
You built a giant castle
With walls so high I couldn't see
The way it all unraveled
And all the things you did to me
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh

I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay
My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay
Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Double OT
I'm a new three
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', oh-ooh
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you

You know how I do it, Concords on my toes

So if I see it, I like it, buy that from the store, ah

Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta

Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band"
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend

Mm-mm
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mm
Yeah (
Hey
My mama called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations"
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it
Yeah, we made it
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like an addict, yeah
I'm surrounded by twenty bad bitch, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yeah
Everyone countin' on me drop the ball, yeah
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eye

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Needless to say, I keep a check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Needless to say, I'm keeping a check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

Ooh,
I fall apart
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah
She told me that I'm not enough
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh,
didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh woah
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh woah

Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin’ up
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin'
I know it piss you off to see me winnin'
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ , yeah
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Everywhere I go
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo
750 Lambo in the Utah snow
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared
Before I dropped
Stoney,
none of y'all really cared
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit
Used to have a lot, but I got more now
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery
Tell me that it's all okay
I've been waitin' on this all damn day
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to—
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands, I just wanna go

Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs somethin' to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight
There's no way I could save you
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

Yeah, yeah
Mmm, ayy
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop
If you busy plottin' on what I got
Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot
Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch
Got no jumper, but I ball a lot
Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want
Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top
Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"
Goddamn, I love paper like I'm Michael Scott
I can do things that your man can not
Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot
Everybody say that I gotta be stopped
Even though my final form ain't unlocked
I'm so ahead of you muhfuckas
How you comprehend what you ain't understandin'?
Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish
Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor
Got a lot of ass, nothin' I can't handle

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home

I've been looking for someone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done
To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

'Cause I can't take it no more
No, you ain't like them bitches, tell them hoes, "Adios"
And you can drop your panties, leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor, I swear we been here before
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section, tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl, this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up
The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in a Lexus, made love in a Lexus
I know you remember
Tell me, is that déjà vu?
'Cause you want me and I want you
Tell me, is that déjà vu?
'Cause, baby, it ain't nothin' new, nah
Tell me, is that déjà vu?
'Cause you want me and I want you
Tell me, is that déjà vu?
'Cause, baby, this ain't nothin' new, oh

You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?
I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
Like I'm the only one
Why'd you throw them stones if you
Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with a view
I thought you knew
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work," hell, I had some help
You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumbling
Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
Already lost the game that you been runnin'
Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
You think that you're so innocent
After all the shit you did
I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
Can't wash our hands of this

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floatin' around in ecstasy
don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm havin' a good time
Havin' a good time
I'm a shootin' star, leapin' through the sky like a tiger
Defyin' the laws of gravity
I'm a racin' car, passin' by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stoppin' me
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you
Don't stop me now
I'm havin' such a good time, I'm havin' a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Don't stop me now
) 'Cause I'm havin' a good time
Don't stop me now
) Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

A duet about how the pressure on our lives makes us nearly crumble. The collaboration emerged from a hectic day of partying and composing by David Bowie and the four members of Queen.
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
Freddie Mercury
Pressure
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you
No man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da
That's okay
Freddie Mercury
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

She keeps Moët et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake", she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime, an invitation you can't decline
Caviar
and cigarettes
Well-versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Pa-pa-pa-pa
) Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Killer
Then again incidentally
Killer
If you're that way inclined
She's a killer queen

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love
And now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Can
anybody find me
Somebody to
love?
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me? (
Yeah, yeah
I have spent all my years in believin' you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody (
Somebody
Ooh, somebody (
Somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Yeah
I work hard (
He works hard
) every day of my life
I work 'till I ache my bones
At the end (
At the end of the day
) I take home
My hard-earned pay all on my own
Goes home, goes home on his own
I get down (
Down
) on my knees (
Knees
) and I start to pray (
Praise the Lord
'Till the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place, singin'
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street
Gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes
Gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

Ooh, let's go!
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway, the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm gonna get along
Without you, when you're gone?
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway, the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old-time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know, or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
adio
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah, blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise

Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you
And where do you go?
You've never seen nothing like it, no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size

A hand above the water
An angel reachin' for the sky
Is it raining in Heaven?
Do you want us to cry?
And everywhere the brokenhearted
On every lonely avenue
No one could reach them
No one but you
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you
Another tricky situation
I get to drowning in the blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well, what would you do?
Yes, it was such an operation
Forever payin' every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through

Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside, my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning
'Round the corner now
Outside, the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark, I'm aching to be free

I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self-satisfied, I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love
It's strange but it's true, yeah
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to be free
Oh, how I want to break free
But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby, can't you see?
I've got to break free

Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go around
Hey, I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before
I left my nursery, huh
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Hey, big woman
You made a bad boy out of me
Hey, hey, woo!
I've been singing with my band
Cross the water, cross the land
I've seen every blue-eyed
Floozy on the way, hey
But their beauty and their style
Went kinda smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
Come on

Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live
Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
Been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
Oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering round
But still come back to you
In rain or shine, you've stood by me girl
I'm happy at home

Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride it where I like
You say black, I say white
You say bark, I say bite
You say shark, I say, hey, man
Jaws
was never my scene
And I don't like
Star Wars
You say Rolls, I say Royce
You say God, Give me a choice!
You say Lord, I say, Christ!
I don't believe in Peter Pan
Frankenstein or Superman
All I wanna do is
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle

Queen’s tribute to Elvis Presley and the early rockabilly style. Surprisingly, it was written in only 10 minutes while Freddie was in the bathtub.
It topped the US charts in February 1980.
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
A-this thing
Called love
It cries
In a cradle all night
It swings
It jives
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
Woo, I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I can dim the lights and sing you songs
Full of sad things
We can do the tango, just for two
I can serenade and gently play
On your heart strings
Be your Valentino, just for you
Ooh love, ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight?"
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy
Ooh, let me feel
Your heartbeat
Ooh, can you feel my love heat?
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me how do you feel, right after all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command
"Ooh love, ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight?
Write my letter, feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone

Yeah!
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light, yeah
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight, yeah
Don't hear the bell, but you answer the call
Yeah, we're just waiting
For the hammer to fall
, yeah
Oh, every night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles
As your body decays
, yeah
Yeah, let the anaesthetic cover it all
You know it's time for the hammer to fall, yeah

There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Ooh
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh
Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?
Freddie Mercury
But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

In the year of '39 assembled here, the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day, and the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day, and they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weight
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darling, we'll away but, my love, this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Baby, your mind is a radio
Got a receiver inside my head
Baby, I'm tuned to your wavelength
Let me tell you what it says
Transmitter
Oh, picking up something good
Hey, radio head
The sound of a brand-new world
Look at my fingers, they vibrate
From their tip down down to my toes
Now I'm receiving your signal
We're gonna leave the land of noise
Transmitter
Oh, picking up something good
Hey,
radio head
The sound of a brand-new world
Radio head
The sound of a brand-new world

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me , myself , and I
Right before you lit my sky up
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia
Keep it one hundred on the land , thе sea , the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands,
your team
, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been  'cause now , you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie

I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it
"Eating out of the trash"
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, "When you know, you know"
And, "When you don't, you don't"
And all of the foes, and all of the friends
Have seen it before, they'll see it again
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong
But my mama told me, "It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

Her name was Kitty
Made her money being pretty and witty
They gave her the keys to this city
Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
I bought a ticket
She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
Looking back, I guess it was kismet
I waited by the stage door,
packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name,
then glowing like the end of a cigarette, wow, she came out
I said, "You're living my drеam"
Then she said to me
"Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never, ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten, so
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna"

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths,
he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us
Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us

A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent
Silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

Radiohead was in the middle of their 1996 tour when they were approached by director Baz Luhrmann to record a song meant for his upcoming film, Romeo + Juliet.
Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape
We escape
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell
Breaks loose
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill
And you can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules
And wisdom choke you

Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
And when it comes
It's so, so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

A fine example of Radiohead’s “post-grunge” / “pre-electronic” phase on The Bends.
Her green plastic watering can
For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic Earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

Please could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken
Voices in my head
What's that?
I may be paranoid, but not an android
What's that?
I may be paranoid, but not an android
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all
What's that?
I may be paranoid, but not an android
What's that?
I may be paranoid, but not an android
(Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na)

I'm the next act waiting in the wings
I'm an animal trapped in your hot car
I am all the days that you choose to ignore
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
I am a moth who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you because there are no others
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's all wrong, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

That there
That's not me
I go
Where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

“Weird Fishes/ Arpeggi” brandishes new drums behind its drain-circling arpeggios, but sounds every bit as massive in crescendoing as its live renditions suggested it might.
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me into phantoms
I follow to the edge
Of the earth
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this
Is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps

Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life

Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell
For what your dirty mind is thinking

Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
Then it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done
This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
A white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You

“Airbag” is the first song off OK Computer.
In the next world war, jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In a neon sign scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe
In a deep, deep sleep of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car, I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

Rihanna comforts her lover by telling him she will be there for him, in good times and bad. The umbrella is a metaphor for her support.
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh (
Good Girl Gone Bad
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Comin' down with the Dow Jones
Ayy, ayy, ayy
When the clouds come, we go,
we Roc-A-Fella (
Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy
We fly higher than weather
in G5's or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back (
Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy
With Little Miss Sunshine
, Rihanna, where you at?  (
Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy
You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Baby, 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said "I'll always be your friend"
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standin' side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go-ooh-oh

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Paul McCartney
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz
Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want

Yayo, yayo

Louis XIII, and it's all on me, nigga, you just bought a shot
Kamikaze, if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot

Like bra, bra, bra
Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot
Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my
Bitch better have my

And, babe, I'm fist-fighting with fire

And I'll run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way (
Feeling this way
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (
Cursing my name
No matter what I do, I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain

Mustard on the beat, ho!
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me

All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me somethin'"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Somethin' in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're livin'
It's not just something you take, it's given
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

“Kiss It Better” tells the story of a broken relationship. She is aware that no one does it like him so instead of arguing all night she ‘kisses it better’.
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Been waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You yell, but cha take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack?
Boy, ya know that you always do it right
Man, fuck yo pride
Just take it on back, boy, take it on back, boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what cha gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurtin' vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in yo eye
What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

In “Sex With Me”, Rihanna makes it clear that having sex with her is something unique; in fact, it’s luxurious and, according to her, “so amazing.”
Sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I cannot mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it
Hit it like you own it, I'ma hit it like I'm on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
Baby, I'ma pick your poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon' need it
I'm off that la-la
I'ma get it wet like jacuzzi, ah-yeah
And sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing, mmmm

I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
So, when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take "no"
I love it when you do what you want 'cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we out late
We don't care what them people say
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So, baby, be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot, it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So, baby, be the life of the party
Together, we can just let go
Pretending like there's no one else here that we know
Slow dance, fall in love as the club track plays
We don't care what them people say

I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left
seein' red
on my own

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off, but I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time in this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mmm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm, mm, mmm
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying, baby
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy?
Mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy?
Mercy on my heart
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride is all I got
I'm saying, baby

I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessin', yeah
Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better
Does it ever?
Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
Oh, I gotta ask
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name
, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah
I love it when you call
señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you know I love it when you call
señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah
But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool
, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up , liftin' me up
And tearin' me down , tearin' me down
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one

I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by
I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder, I wonder

Khalid
Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growin', nah
Wakin' up to headlines, filled with devastation again
My heart is broken, but I keep goin'
with Khalid
Pain, but I won't let it turn into
hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
Khalid
It's hard to sleep at night, knowin' what's outside
Feelin' hopeless
, I need focus
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no

Ah-ah, he-hey
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, he-hey
Ah-ah, ah-ah
He knows
Dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killin' me?
He knows, he knows
D-d-does he know
Another's hands have touched my skin?
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows
It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away (
I'm slippin' away
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone (
The pictures on my phone
She's not coming home (
I'm not comin' home
Comin' home, comin' home
I know what you did last summer (
Ah-ah
Just lied to me, "There's no other" (
He-hey
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
I know what you did last summer (
Ah-ah
Look me in the eyes, my lover (
He-hey
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been

Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak, open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changin' our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feelin' your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinkin', baby
You  are bringin' out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

Are we gonna make it?
Is this gonna hurt?
Oh, we can try to sedate it
But that never works
Yeah
I start to imagine a world where we don't collide
It's making me sick, but we'll heal and the sun will rise
If you tell me you're leaving, I'll make it easy
It'll be okay
If we can't stop the bleeding, we don't have to fix it
We don't have to stay
I will love you either way
It'll be o—, be okay
Oh, the future we dreamed of
Is fading to black, oh
And, oh, thеre's nothing more painful
Nothing more painful, oh-woah
I start to imaginе a world where we don't collide
And it's making me sick, but we'll heal and the sun will rise

Oh, there she goes again, every morning, it's the same
You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standin'
You got me thinkin' what we could be 'cause
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams, you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinkin' we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
Need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then, I woke up to the cold air
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Where were you in the morning, baby?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

I saw you on a Sunday in a café
And all you did was look my way
And my heart started to race
And my hands started to shake, yeah
I heard you asked about me through a friend
And my adrenaline kicked in
Cause I've been askin' 'bout you, too
And now we're right here in this room
I get a little bit nervous around you
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
Get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Talk a little too much, yeah, around you
I talk a little too much, yeah
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you
I get a little self-conscious
Get a little excited
I get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe
We walked in the rain, a couple blocks to your apartment
You told me to come inside, caught me staring in your eyes
And I'm not usually like this
But I like what you're doing to me, ah, what you're doing to me

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anythin', when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down
I'm the one for a good time call
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, I feel the love
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live
Like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly
Like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
But I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight, on for tonight

Come on, come on, turn the radio on

But I got you, baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long

Uh-oh, runnin' out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, I need another lover, be mine
'Cause I, I, I got stamina
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no, no, no
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no, no, no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Well, uh-oh, runnin' out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, runnin' now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
And oh yeah, runnin' through the waves of love
But I, I got stamina
And oh yeah, I'm runnin' and I've just enough
And uh-oh, I got stamina

Don't cry, snowman, not in front of me
Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling?
If you can't catch me, darling
Don't cr
, snowman, don't leave me this way
A puddle of water can't hold me close, baby
Can't hold me close, baby
I want you to know that I'm never leaving
'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
So come on, let's go
Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I'll love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas, baby
My snowman and me,
My snowman and me
Baby
Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey?
Without legs to run, honey
Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tear
Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby?
If you don't have ears, baby

Sean Paul
'Til I hit the dance floor (
Bada bang
Hit the dance floor (
Bada bang
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby
Just you and me
Sean Paul
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I don't need no money
You're worth more dan diamond, more dan gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus tek control
I don't need no money
You're worth more dan diamond, more dan gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outta control

I'm trying but I keep falling down
I cry out but nothing comes now
I'm giving my all and I know peace will come
I never wanted to need someone
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
And if you let go I'll float towards the sun
I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up
But when the fear comes and I drift towards the ground
I am lucky that you're around
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul

“Unstoppable” serves as an empowerment anthem which beat builds as the song progresses.
I'll smile, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear
Keep my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time, yeah-yeah
I put my armour on, show you how strong I am
I put my armour on, I'll show you that I am
I'm unstoppable, I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible, yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful, I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today
Breakdown, only alone I will cry out loud
You'll never see what's hiding out
Hiding out deep down, yeah-yeah
I know, I've heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I'm too afraid now, yeah

Up, I won't give up, I won't give up
I won't give up, I won't give up
And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least, that's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

As Swift said in her Rolling Stone interview:
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to
You and I
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
It's time, oh-oh
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one-horse town,
I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
There's nothin' stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
And if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
But that's okay
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now, it's all too late, so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true
'Cause I know you
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone, oh
Oh, oh

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?
You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, "Hey, by the way"

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said,
"Oh, my, my, my"
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh, my, my, my"

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Oh, yeah, oh
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say "hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
with Colbie Caillat
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around
with Colbie Caillat
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break,
no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
with Colbie Caillat
And I can't
breathe
without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
with Colbie Caillat
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
You're not sorry

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and
endearing
And I'm comfortable

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now, you're halfway out the door
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it
rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
"We should be together"
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is, "Come closer"
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

This version of the song captures the raw emotions behind the lyrics.
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin' to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Mr. "Perfect face," Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right, Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"
But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
Mr. "Never told me why,"
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology, so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day, forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shinin' bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy
I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good-girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Looking at it now
Last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

Been sittin' eyes wide open
Behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like it's no point hopin' at all
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I'm sittin' eyes wide open
And I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wonderin' if I dodged a bullet
Or just lost the love of my life, oh

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Future
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (
Woah, woah
I wanna be your end game, end game
Future
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (
Yeah
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (
Git, git
And I heard about you, ooh (
Yeah
You like the bad ones too
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me
I'm one call away whenever you need me
I'm in a G5 , come to the A-Side
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I’d be the man
They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh , let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kinda guy the ladies want
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it

It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they’re right
You were outnumbered this time
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter,
your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the
tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say,
"I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Nice
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world , have you heard?
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you , but I miss sparklin'

Meet me at midnight
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel
The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one-night or a wife

I-I-I-I
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I’ve been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
I-I-I-I
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what wе do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voicе is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an
endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the
effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you
, but I touched you
And for a fortnight there,
we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask
Now you're in my backyard, turned
into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there,
we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

So  long , London
So  long , London
So  long , London
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe
Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?"
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from
the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
"You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"
And who's gonna hold you like me?
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie,
in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him"
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from
For a moment, I knew cosmic love
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
"Fuck it if I can't have him"
"I might just die, it would make no difference"
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?
Once the flight had flown
With the wilt of the rose
I slept all alone
You still wouldn't go
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?
Is it? Is it? Is it?
Whеn you lost control
Red blood, white snow
Blue dress on a boat
Your new girl is my clone

When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill
each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave
And then she wrotе headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you
And in the blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
I'm watchin'
American Pie
with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
But look at you
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me?
It's just a game, but really
I'm bettin' on all three  for us two
Get my car door, isn't that sweet?
Then pull mе to the back seat
No one's ever had me , not like you

Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her likе an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any measurе of a man

Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me "Downtown Lights"
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves
the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?
What if he's written
"mine"
on my
upper thigh
only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, "There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk"
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh

I took a page out of your favorite book
You sold me lies just by the way you look
Taught me a language that I'd never speak
Baby, that ain't for me, that, that ain't for me
I dug my grave watchin' the way you move
You took me higher than I ever flew, ooh
Too many times, gave you a second chance
Baby, I'm just a man, I'm, I'm just a man
No more thinkin' about you late night
No more runnin' around with your friends and I'm
Done pickin' the pieces of my
Soul up off the floor, oh, oh
I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willin'
But tonight, I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't wanna lose you, baby
But I can't play this gamе no more
I thought it would kill me
But tonight, I saved my lifе when I showed you the door

Sun is going down, time is running out
No one else around but me
Steady losing light, steady losing my mind
Moving shadows and grinding teeth
Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I'd do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you, I keep
Slipping into bad dreams
Where there's no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these
Bad dreams
Waitin' on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these, all of these
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bad dreams
Ooh, ooh, ooh
All of these

Are you even real
Or did I make you up?
How could someone like you
Wanna give me love?
Don't think I deserve you
But I can't get enough
You're so beautiful, spiritual
More like a miracle
Part of me's scared that you
Might be invisible
Too good to be true
Tell me
Are you, are you
Are you, are you
Made up in my head, or are you in my bedroom?
Questions that I ask ever since I met you
Tеll me
Are you , arе you
Are you, are you
Somethin' from a dream or somethin' that I made up?
Questions that I ask every time that I wake up

No, woah
I woke up this morning kinda mad
Flipped a switch, I had the urge to beat your ass
Mm-mm
Turnin' up you in a different state
You fucked it up with me all kinds of ways, I'm mad
Boy, I'm so mad
You wanna tell me it was nothing
Why don't you tell me I'm a fool?
Say you're sorry 'bout it
I would be, too
I got no mercy
You don't deserve me, no
And you might be hurtin'
But damn it, you hurt me, boy
So I'll watch you suffer
Crawl back to me on broken glass
And you better love her
Regret will drive a person mad
I got no mercy
That shit was dirty
Dirty, dirty, dirty

Walking down the street last night
Watching strangers pass me by
Where do all our shadows go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know
I can fool my senses for a little while
But some things are too hard to reconcile
When I look into your eyes
There's no answers I can't find
It's a feeling that I've never known
And, when I'm wide awake tonight
Running circles in my mind
There's an answer I can't find
When did your heart let me go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know
I guess, somе things, I'll never know
I'm running out of avenuеs
'Cause every road leads back to you
When memories fade, where do they go?
I guess, some things, I'll never know

Of havin' only eyes for you
Of letting you turn my crimson skies blue, ooh
Of hatin' your somebody new
Of gettin' hella jealous of the ground that's under you, ooh
Of goin' way too hard
Or tryna call you while I'm stormin' out the bar
Of goin' way across the line
Of needin' you at the end of every night
I'm guilty, baby
I'm guilty, baby
If havin' a bleeding heart is a crime
If lovin' you means I'm servin' life
I'm guilty, baby
Of usin' medicine as a crutch
On the nights when the voices in my head won't shut up
Of goin' way (
Of goin' way
) too far (
Too far
Or drivin' by your place and countin' up the cars (
Up the cars
Of goin' way (
Of goin' way
) across the line (
Across the line
Of needin' you at the end of every night

God went crazy when He painted you
Ain't seen nothin' like this before, mm
Took a little extra time on you
Before He let you walk out the door
You got that smile, babe
You got that subtle Mona Lisa, drive me wild, babe
I'd give it all up just to keep you by my side, babe
I knew it from the jump
Fit right in my arms like you the one
Yeah, I'm made for you
I prayed for you
There's a light in your eyes every color in the sky
Don't come close to
Yеah, I'm made for you
I prayed for you
Swear that God wеnt crazy when He painted you
Ooh
Ooh

Got you cryin' on my shoulder
And I know better than to listen
Just because you're stayin' over
Doesn't mean that you're forgiven
We both know what you done, what you done
Don't love anyone, anyone
Anyone but yourself, oh
Just when I think I found the strength to go and push you away, away, oh
I pull you in again, oh, I'm such a sucker for the pain, pain, pain
Baby
I'm helpless, baby
Porcelain in your hands, bound to fall apart
You know how to break me
Hammer to the heart
Caption it passion, and then
Capture me, trap me instead
Happy to die in that web
Wrapped in the sheets of your bed
Ooh, know the only way I'm leaving
Ooh, is in pieces

Oh, oh
Walk this walk, you need no boots
I see myself each time I look at you
She's got it
) Everything that I need
She’s got it
) Always been so good to me
She's got it
) Now show me how you do it
She's got it
) First things first, it’s a real body
Born with it, she don't need no practice
Two first-class tickets just to fit that ass in
Been through it and she move right past it
That big body, big money, check your balance, yeah
She a ten plus three
Can't buy this honey and that shit ain't free
Look around you, ain't nobody average
She turn "can't have it" into a habit, yeah
Walk this walk, you need no boots
I see myself each time I look at you

My whole life I've been waiting for someone to fix this broken man
Every moment, a twist of a fate, but it made me who I am
I'd be lying if I told you that I knew
I had a life before there was you
But these small hands
They don't care where I come from, where I've been
Oh, I never loved myself, until the day I held
These small hands
Ooh, ooh, ooh
There was no getting ready, but I am glad I'm overwhelmed
The way you look back at me, it's like I finally see myself
In your mother's eyes, it's like they were made for you
But I can't lie, I got so much work to do
These small hands
They don't care where I come from, where I've been
Oh, I never loved myself, until the day I held
These small hands
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Girl, I guess you're doin' me a favor
Melt my armor down to chains and bolts
Love to you's a synonym of danger
Gas can light a flame with no remorse
Don't know why I let this go, go on for so long
Fake tears can never stain quite like the real ones
Pick a time you wasn't lying, bet you couldn't name me one
Name me one
If you can just leave me in the dead of the night
If you can deceive me looking dead in my eyes
You don't have to say it, baby, I understand
That I'm not your man, no, I'm not your man
This ain't how you trеat somebody you say you love
I gave you еverything, it still ain't enough
You don't have to say it, baby, I understand
That I'm not your man, no, I'm not your man
Once or twice ain't nothin' but a number
But don't say that you're sorry now
If I knew what it was, I would've been done, gave you up
There ain't no crawlin' back, I shut that down

Maybe it's the midnight air
Something 'bout the summer night
Maybe it's the stars up there
That made me say what's on my mind
I love the way you twist your hair
I'm seeing how you roll your eyes
I'm watching how your cheeks turn red
Must mean I'm doing something right
I ain't just blowing smoke
Girl, tonight, you look so beautiful
This must be a blessing, I just had to take a second
Step aside and catch my—
And let you know
Promise, girl, I ain't just blowing smoke
Let's go somewhere where we can be alone
Roll one up and burn it extra slow until the morning
Feeling like I had to come and let you know
Maybe you were Heaven-sent, yeah
Or maybe it's a waste of time
But I'm willing to take that bet
So, darling, will you roll the dice?
You already know you're a ten and it shows
Everyone hoping you walked in alone
So stop me if I say too much
'Cause I can never say enough

You lay your head
Gently on my shoulder
We made big plans
They changed as we got older
Oh, I know now what I didn't before
Sometimes, it's good to let a good thing go
But in my head, you're still mine
And I go back every night
I see your face in summer skies
I count the stars inside your eyes
Oh, what went wrong and what went right?
It fades away as years go by
We may not have a whole lifetime
But at least we had the Northern Lights
It hurts like hell
Admittin' I still miss you
Your heart in my hand
Somehow, I let it slip through, oh

I got eyes for the pain and darkness
She got smiles in a jar by the door
Senses when my sky is fallin'
My roof, my shelter from the storm
No, she don't mind all the times that my heart's been black and blue, mm
Sees the tears in my eyes from a different point of view
Well, she likes her days
Better when the sun go down
Yeah, she loves the rain
Well, maybe that means she can love me somehow
When the sky turns gray, you should see her face
She ain't even fazed by the clouds
She loves the rain
Well, maybe that means she can love me somehow
Keeps half a shell she found in Destin, mm
Right on top her bedroom drawer, mm
Next to a dozen dyin' flowers
She waits until the petals fall onto her floor

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever gettin' older

“Something Just Like This” is about a relationship that doesn’t need to be superhumanly perfect.
I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control and Batman with his fists
And clearly, I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, "Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?"
I'm not lookin' for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

We were stayin' in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair, but I thought,
"How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?"
If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were stayin' in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Postin' pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Gettin' drunk on the past we were livin' in

Daya asks her boyfriend to save her and prove that the good boys don’t hide away.
Crashin', hit a wall
Right now, I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reachin' out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around
I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losin' my mind now
It's in my head, darlin', I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
R-R-Runnin' out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side

Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Take it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher
Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew, hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room, hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Say you'll never let me go

I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations and sometimes they go wrong
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want and if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feelin' is like
And I say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-eah
And I say yeah, yeah-eah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-eah
Yeah, yeah-eah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-eah
I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions and stand by what you said
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Yeah, we're united under our indifference
And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

Playboi Carti
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine (
What?
Playboi Carti
Yeah, look, huh, nigga, this my shit
Welcome to the city of Gods (
What?
Pop was the king of New York, now I'm the nigga in charge
Only the drillers, the city is ours
We found out the opps and we pick 'em apart
I give 'em my time so I give 'em my heart
If the city love me, then I'm really a star (
What?
New York City, please go easy on me tonight
Nеw York City, please go easy on this hеart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me
Playboi Carti
Yeah, look, this is the city of money and violence
Everything we do is gon' come with a challenge
Every bitch you fuck is gon' come with a balance (
What?
Every shooter with me is coming in silence (
What?
And you niggas better pick a side
You niggas side hoppin'
If I want 'em to not let you come into the city, it's my option
This is the home of the fly shoppin'
This where the bitches gon' watch pockets
When I'm on TV, I gotta look good
'Cause I know the whole block watchin'
If you chill with the opps, we is not vibin'
If I see 'em in person, we Fox 5 'em
Yeah, the police is on us, we not stoppin'
This is the town of the big drip , smooth talk
Milly Rock , Shmoney Dance , Woo Walk
You will not survive being too soft
Been a long time, we took a new loss
Shooters shootin' 'til we got a new corpse
If we stop then we lettin' it cool off

You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I
Arrive, I count the seconds
Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this,
I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one
I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

When Jason was at the table
I kept on seeing him look at me when he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
Because, he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Did you see her?
She's so short, and that dress is so tacky
Who wears Cheetah?
It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing "Summertime Sadness"?
After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette? I really need one
But first, let me take a selfie
Let me take a selfie
Can you guys help me pick a filter?
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be? I want it to be clever
How about "Living with my bitches, #LIVE"?
I only got ten likes in the last five minutes
Do you think I should take it down?
Let me take another selfie

It's 4 AM, I don't know where to go
Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are taking me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows
That, ooh, the side effect to my loneliness is you
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
This happens every time I try to mix
Decision making with one too many drinks
But, ooh, if late-night friends have consequences, cool, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, I think about it all the time
Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

Yeah, let's do it again but, uh, this time, uh, let's go full psycho
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friend
She says she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it, yeah, the more I take offense
I'm so defeated, I can't get outside my head
I post a picture of myself 'cause I'm lonely
Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
I'm so defeated, I just want this shit to end
So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
Like everybody hates me
Like everybody hates me
I'm a product of the internet
And now, I'm face to face with all the voices in my head
I can't even check the time without facing regret
Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said?
And I'm not tryna be like, "Poor me," I made it
I'm just trying to stay normal now that they know what my name is
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
Yeah, they're the reason that I still am who I am

Yeah
Found cigarettes in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even smoke
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you no one knew
Yeah, you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flip it on me, say I think too much
You're movin' different when we makin' love
Baby, tell me, tell me
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy, where you been sleepin'?
This shit is keepin' me up at night, just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love?
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now?
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love?
I wanna know, I wanna know who

Two kids with their hearts on fire
Who's gonna save us now?
When we thought that we couldn't get higher
Things started looking down
I look at you and you look at me
Like nothing but strangers now
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Don't let it burn us out
Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you, yeah
Come on, let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah
You said, "Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said, "I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
So I call you mine
Can I call you mine?
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"

Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Where do you think you're going?
It's so late, late, late, what's wrong?
I said, "I can't stay, do I have to give a reason?"
It's just me, me, me, it's what I want
So how did we get here?
Three weeks now, we've been so caught up
Better if we do this on our own
Before I love you, na-na-na
I'm gonna leave you, na-na-na
Before I'm someone you leave behind
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine
Before I love you, na-na-na
I'm gonna leave you, na-na-na
Even if I'm not here to stay
I still want your heart

Whoa, oh
So far, so good
Mmm, oh, yep
Why?
You only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
Tell me that you're gonna change, then act like this instead
I'm too old to want somebody who's always switching up their friends
I can't make you love me, but at least you could pretend
Scrips gonna lead to fifths until I'm fucked out of my head
You play the same old songs
I know that you're different in your Air Force 1's
Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue
Like I got an addiction, yeah
You always say this shit's gonna change, but it never does

I go through your iPad looking for
Something that I used to have
Guess I finally lost my mind
I wish that I could take my number back
Go back to the place we met
Start this up a second time
You're living in a past life, twenty-five
All your friends are verified
Acting like they're first in line
I'm looking at your life through cellophane
Hoping things would stay the same
I was always by your side
And isn't it strange
How we're strangers again?
Isn't it strange
How we're strangers again?
And now we're strangеrs again
And now we're strangers again
You wеre just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen
Hurt me 'til I feel alive

Where will you go when it's over?
Who will you know when it's over?
I know, yeah, I saw you, you know that, right?
Just know that I saw you
Where will you go when it's over?
Do you get lost on your own?
I know, yeah, I saw you, you know that, right?
Just know that I saw you
Late night, zip ties
Make you wanna miss your flight
Flipping through your feelings like a Gemini
I'm staring at your dark side
So far, so gone
Standing with a white dress on
Only say you need me when your friends gone home
You're tryna get your mind right
But if I only get one life, this is what I wanna do
And if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
And if I only have one night, yeah, I'd spend it with you
So if I only get one life, I wanna live it with you
I’m gonna live it with you

I feel jet-lagged everyday
I've been out my mind, drinking anyway
Do you have the time? Tell me what's the date
Might be out of line but I feel in place
I thought I heard you say
Up and down in the crowd
Finally, I feel better now
Off the ground, in the clouds
Wish that you could see me now
I don't doubt, say it loud
Came up from the underground
Turned around, made it out
I wish that you could see me now
I wish that you could see me now
Wish that you could see me now
I wish that you could see me now
I wish that you could see me now
Wish that you could see me now
I wish that you could see me now
Up and down in the crowd
Finally, I feel better now
Off the ground, in the clouds
Wish that you could see me now
I don't doubt, say it loud
Came up from the undеrground
Turned around, made it out
I wish that you could see me now
Up and down in thе crowd
Finally, I feel better now
Off the ground, in the clouds
Wish that you could see me now
I don't doubt, say it loud
Came up from the underground
Turned around, made it out
I wish that you could see me now

Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood
All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

I don't really say this that often
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me
Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losin', but I'm losin' my mind
Does anybody know what that's like?
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody
You should've known better
Than to listen to your heart again
People change with the weather
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else
You put it back together
Don't let it fall apart again
People change with the weather
In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need 'em now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna please somebody, somebody

I would have walked through fire to kiss your lips
Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been
Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why
You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope
Hope
Hope
Hope
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

Young
We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can grow from this, yeah
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can grow from this, yeah
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

The other one is, of course, outing yourself
I think be the first to out yourself, I always think
Because, you know, there's no end to the hypocrisy of the human heart
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
It's 5 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you
But I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though
I'm just on the radio
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

Seneler sürer her günüm
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Seneler sürer her günüm
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Yalnız gitmekten yorgunum
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around, bring your friend with you
But we ain't really gonna sleep at all
You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures
In my city, I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous
She asked me if I do this every day, I said, "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby, I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl, I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin'
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private
, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like

I'ma care for you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you
You make it look like it's magic
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
And I'm so used to bein' used
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah
Girl, you earned it, yeah
You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful
And stay forever young
This I know, uh
This I know
She told me, "Don't worry
About it"
She told me, "Don't worry
No more"
We both know we can't go
Without it
She told me, "You'll never
Be alo-oh-oh-ooh"
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh

Ayy
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait?
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name?
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro
Ayy
Young Metro, young Metro
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now
I'm talkin'
Time
Rolling Stone
, and
Bazaar
now (
Bazaar
now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

Yeah
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty
No one's around to judge me
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

Thought I almost died in my dream again
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep
Without you, I can't sleep
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Ooh, yeah
I just pretend that I'm in the dark and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you

Ooh
Na-na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I saw the fire in your eyes
I saw the fire when I look into your eyes
You tell me things you wanna try
I know temptation is the devil in disguise
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice
You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light
It's like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says
Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babe
Bring me close to—

I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you

It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night

I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfеct
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we'rе goin' through it (
And it makes you feel alone

Traffic dies while we are racin' home
Melted lights cover the open road
I hope we make it 'cause I've been chasin'
Another odyssey, oh
I can't wait to see your face
Crash when we're switchin' lanes
My love's beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake
We're dancin' in the flames
It's indescribable
Ooh, yeah
"The world can't heal," they say on the radio
So grab the wheel, want you to be in control
We're dodgin' headlights, and you say, "Hold tight"
Another odyssey, oh

You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with

I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how—
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me

Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo

'Cause all y'all other—
Out there doing what I'm doing
Or tryna do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh? Come on
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, "Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly?"
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it—
My way
My way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way
My way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

What you doing? Really?
You know I'm coming over, right?
Now, you got it hot for me already, baby?
Okay
Uh, give me ten minutes
Be ready
Hey, wear that little thing I like, yeah
It's seven o'clock on the dot
I'm in my drop top, cruising the streets, ah yeah

I pull up, anticipating
Good love, don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I never seen, girl, you know what I mean
Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt, ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow
See, I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be making love until the sun comes up, baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow

Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got somethin' to tell you
Listen
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See, this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you
But you remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
Thought that she was the one for me
'Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexin' everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

Second single off of 8701, a Billboard Hot 100 chart topping R&B ballad.
Ooh-oh

No, no, no, no, no, no, no

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone , hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh
Come on, that's how it's going down
You smell it? Hah, yeah
You smell it? Hah, yeah
Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh
Situations will arise
In our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
I loved you, you were my girl
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leaving, baby
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight

Let's
Up in the club with my homies
Tryna get a little V-I, keep it down on the low-key
'Cause you know how it is (
Hey, hey
I saw this shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear, you would think that she know me
I decided to chill (
Okay
Conversation got heavy (
Hey
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
Watch out!
Watch out!
She was sayin', "Come get me"
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, "Baby, let's go" (
Let's go
When I told her, I said

Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time comin', but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn , let it burn , gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn , let it burn , gotta let it burn

Watch this
